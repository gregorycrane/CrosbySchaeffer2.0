30	318	1.5.10	ἔπειτ’ οὐκ οἴει φροντίζειν ;		Across the Euphrates river in the course of these desert marches was a large and prosperous city named Charmande.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
31	425	1.7.14	εἰκὸς γάρ , ἔφη .		From there Cyrus marched one stage, three parasangs, with his whole army, Greek and barbarian alike, drawn up in line of battle;	['γάρ']	1	['γάρ']	['OBJ/AuxY']
32	594	1.10.13	οὐ δῆτα , ἔφη ·		so the hill became gradually cleared of the horsemen.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['OBJ/AuxZ']
33	595	1.10.13	τοῦτό γε οὐκ οἴομαι .		At last they were all gone.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
56	13	1.1.6	τὸ δαιμόνιον γὰρ ἔφη σημαίνειν .		Lastly, as regards his Greek force, he proceeded to collect it with the utmost secrecy, so that he might take the King as completely unprepared as possible.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
57	215	1.4.3	Σωκράτης δ’ οὐ ταῦτ’ ἔλεγε ·		Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian also arrived with this fleet, coming in response to Cyrus’ summons, together with seven hundred hoplites, over whom he continued to hold command in the army of Cyrus.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['AuxZ']
58	429	1.7.15	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .		[Here also are the canals, which flow from the Tigris river;	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['OBJ/AuxY']
59	441	1.7.19	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .		Hence on the following day Cyrus proceeded more carelessly;	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['OBJ/AuxY']
60	451	1.8.7	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .		and the men carried, besides their other weapons, Greek sabres.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['OBJ/AuxY']
61	466	1.8.12	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .		At this moment Cyrus rode along the line, attended only by Pigres, his interpreter, and three or four others, and shouted to Clearchus to lead his army against the enemy’s centre, for the reason that the King was stationed there;	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['OBJ/AuxY']
99	87	1.2.13	δήλω δ’ ἐγενέσθην ἐξ ὧν ἐπραξάτην ·		Thence he marched two stages, ten parasangs, to the inhabited city of Thymbrium.	['ἐκ', 'δῆλος']	2	['ἐξ', 'δήλω']	['AuxP', 'SBJ']
100	100	1.2.17	ἐσθλῶν μὲν γὰρ ἄπ’ ἐσθλὰ διδάξεαι ·		When he had driven past them all, he halted his chariot in front of the centre of the phalanx, and sending his interpreter Pigres to the generals of the Greeks, gave orders that the troops should advance arms and the phalanx move forward in a body.	['ἀπό', 'μέν', 'γάρ']	3	['ἄπ’', 'μὲν', 'γὰρ']	['AuxP', 'AuxY', 'AuxY']
101	224	1.4.4	βελτίους γὰρ ποιῶν τοὺς συγγιγνομένους ἀπέπεμπεν .		Besides, there were towers upon both the walls.	['ἀγαθός', 'γάρ']	2	['βελτίους', 'γὰρ']	['OCOMP', 'AuxY']
102	228	1.4.6	ὧν ἐκεῖνος πάντων ἀνθρώπων πλεῖστον ἀπεῖχεν .		it was a trading place, and many merchant ships were lying at anchor there.	['ἄνθρωπος']	1	['ἀνθρώπων']	['ATR']
103	507	1.8.29	μαρτυρεῖ δὲ καὶ Ἐπίχαρμος ἐν τῷδε ·		He also wore a necklace and bracelets and all the other ornaments that the noblest Persians wear;	['ἐν']	1	['ἐν']	['AuxP']
104	509	1.9.1	καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ δὲ τόπῳ φησίν ·		In this way, then, Cyrus came to his end, a man who was the most kingly and the most worthy to rule of all the Persians who have been born since Cyrus the Elder, as all agree who are reputed to have known Cyrus intimately.	['ἐν']	1	['ἐν']	['AuxP']
105	549	1.9.23	ἀνέχονται γὰρ ἕως ἂν ἐπιθυμήσωσιν αὐτῶν ·		As for all the gifts which people sent him to wear upon his person, whether intended for war or merely for show, it is reported that he said of them that his own person could not be adorned with all these things, but that in his opinion friends nobly adorned were a man’s greatest ornament.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
149	76	1.2.11	καὶ γὰρ μόνος ἡγοῖτ’ ἂν δύνασθαι πείθειν .		Thence he marched two stages, twelve parasangs, to the inhabited city of Ceramon-agora, the last Phrygian city as one goes toward Mysia.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
150	90	1.2.14	ἐγὼ δὲ πρὸς τοῦτο μὲν οὐκ ἀντιλέγω ·		There he remained three days.	['μέν', 'οὐ']	2	['μὲν', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
151	95	1.2.15	ἐγὼ δὲ περὶ τούτων οὐχ οὕτω γιγνώσκω ·		Menon and his troops occupied the right wing, Clearchus and his troops the left, and the other generals the centre.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐχ']	['AuxZ']
152	118	1.2.21	οὐ μὴν τά γε ἄλλα οὕτω κρίνεται .		And in fact, Syennesis was said to be upon the heights, guarding the entrance.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['AuxZ']
153	122	1.2.22	οὕτω δὲ καὶ Σωκράτην δίκαιον ἦν κρίνειν ·		Thence he descended to a large and beautiful plain, well-watered and full of trees of all sorts and vines.	['δίκαιος']	1	['δίκαιον']	['PNOM']
154	258	1.4.13	τοιαῦτα μὲν περὶ τούτων ἔπαιζεν ἅμα σπουδάζων .		He promised that he would give every man five minas in silver when they reached Babylon and their pay in full until he brought the Greeks back to Ionia again.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
155	259	1.4.13	ἀφροδισίων δὲ παρῄνει τῶν καλῶν ἰσχυρῶς ἀπέχεσθαι ·		By these promises the greater part of the Greek army was persuaded.	['ἰσχυρός', 'καλός']	2	['ἰσχυρῶς', 'καλῶν']	['ADV', 'OBJ']
156	263	1.4.14	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν .		At this moment Cyrus is begging the Greeks to follow him against the King.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['OBJ/AuxY']
157	353	1.6.3	οὕτω γὰρ ἂν μόνως ὁ τοιοῦτος σωθείη .		but this man took it and gave it to Cyrus.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
158	422	1.7.12	δοκεῖ γοῦν μοι ἡ τροφὴ ἀρχὴ εἶναι ·		But of the forces just enumerated only nine hundred thousand, with one hundred and fifty scythe-bearing chariots, were present at the battle.	['ἀρχή']	1	['ἀρχὴ']	['PNOM']
159	540	1.9.18	οὐδὲν γὰρ πώποτε σεαυτῆς ἔργον καλὸν τεθέασαι .		Again, so surely as a man performed with credit any service that he assigned him, Cyrus never let his zeal go unrewarded.	['γάρ', 'καλός', 'ἔργον']	3	['γὰρ', 'καλὸν', 'ἔργον']	['AuxY', 'ATR', 'OBJ']
187	20	1.1.8	πιστεύων δὲ θεοῖς πῶς οὐκ εἶναι θεοὺς ἐνόμιζεν ;		Meanwhile he sent to the King and urged, on the ground that he was his brother, that these Ionian cities should be given to him instead of remaining under the rule of Tissaphernes, and his mother co-operated with him in this.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
188	21	1.1.8	ἀλλὰ μὴν ἐποίει καὶ τάδε πρὸς τοὺς ἐπιτηδείους .		The result was that the King failed to perceive the plot against himself, but believed that Cyrus was spending money on his troops because he was at war with Tissaphernes.	['ἀλλά', 'ἐπιτήδειος']	2	['ἀλλὰ', 'ἐπιτηδείους']	['AuxY', 'ADV']
189	32	1.1.10	τοὺς θεοὺς γὰρ οἷς ἂν ὦσιν ἵλεῳ σημαίνειν .		Thus the army in Thessaly, again, was being secretly maintained for him.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
190	44	1.2.3	περὶ μὲν οὖν τῶν ταῦτα πραγματευομένων τοιαῦτα ἔλεγεν ·		Xenias, then, arrived at Sardis with the troops from the cities, who were hoplites to the number of four thousand._Proxenus was there with hoplites to the number of fifteen hundred, and five hundred light-armed troops, Sophaenetus the Stymphalian with a thousand hoplites, Socrates the Achaean with about five hundred hoplites, and Pasion the Megarian arrived with three hundred hoplites and three hundred peltasts.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
191	62	1.2.8	οὐ μὴν οὐδ’ ἐρασιχρημάτους γε τοὺς συνόντας ἐποίει .		the Marsyas also flows through the city, and empties into the Maeander.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['AuxZ']
192	275	1.4.17	ἐνίησι γάρ τι τὰ φαλάγγια κατὰ τὸ δῆγμα .		And in the crossing no one was wetted above the breast by the water.	['γάρ']	1	['γάρ']	['AuxY']
193	326	1.5.12	τί δὲ φῦλον ἄλλο ἢ ἄνθρωποι θεοὺς θεραπεύουσι ;		On the same day Clearchus, after going to the place where they crossed the river and there inspecting the market, was riding back to his own tent through Menon’s army, having only a few men with him.	['ἄνθρωπος']	1	['ἄνθρωποι']	['ADV/SBJ']
194	482	1.8.18	καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα πάντα κεκτημένοι ὅμως ἀδικοῦνται ·		at the same moment they all set up the sort of war-cry which they raise to Enyalius, and all alike began running.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
195	503	1.8.27	λείη μὲν ὁδός , μάλα δ’ ἐγγύθι ναίει .		on the other side, Cyrus himself was killed and eight of the noblest of his attendants lay dead upon him.	['μέν', 'ὁδός']	2	['μὲν', 'ὁδός']	['AuxY', 'CO/SBJ']
196	523	1.9.9	καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ἡ ἑτέρα γυνὴ προσελθοῦσα εἶπε ·		Consequently, when he came to hostilities with Tissaphernes, all the cities of their own accord chose Cyrus rather than Tissaphernes, with the exception of Miletus;	['ἐν']	1	['ἐν']	['AuxP']
197	532	1.9.14	ὦ τλῆμον , τί δὲ σὺ ἀγαθὸν ἔχεις ;		But it was the brave in war, as all agree, whom he honoured especially.	['ἀγαθός']	1	['ἀγαθὸν']	['ATR']
241	2	1.1.1	ἡ μὲν γὰρ γραφὴ κατ’ αὐτοῦ τοιάδε τις ἦν ·		Now when Darius lay sick and suspected that the end of his life was near, he wished to have both his sons with him.	['μέν', 'γάρ']	2	['μὲν', 'γὰρ']	['AuxY', 'AuxY']
242	7	1.1.3	διετεθρύλητο γὰρ ὡς φαίη Σωκράτης τὸ δαιμόνιον ἑαυτῷ σημαίνειν ·		And Artaxerxes, believing the accusation, arrested Cyrus, with the intention of putting him to death;	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
243	150	1.3.3	καὶ γὰρ οἶμαι αὐτοὺς ἤδη κατατετρῖφθαι διαθρυλουμένους ὑπὸ σοῦ .		And I, receiving this money, did not lay it up for my own personal use or squander it in pleasure, but I proceeded to expend it on you.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
244	216	1.4.3	καὶ γὰρ ἑαυτὸν οὕτω γ’ ἂν ᾤετο δεῖν παίεσθαι ·		And the ships lay at anchor alongside Cyrus’ tent.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
245	221	1.4.4	τοῖς γὰρ μὴ ἔχουσι χρήματα διδόναι οὐκ ἤθελον διαλέγεσθαι .		The entire distance from one wall to the other was three stadia;	['γάρ', 'οὐ']	2	['γὰρ', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
246	260	1.4.13	οὐ γὰρ ἔφη ῥᾴδιον εἶναι τῶν τοιούτων ἁπτόμενον σωφρονεῖν .		But as for Menon, before it was clear what the rest of the soldiers would do, that is, whether they would follow Cyrus or not, he gathered together his own troops apart from the others and spoke as follows:	['γάρ', 'οὐ']	2	['γὰρ', 'οὐ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
247	265	1.4.15	οὗτος κἂν εἰς μαχαίρας κυβιστήσειε κἂν εἰς πῦρ ἅλοιτο .		For if they vote to follow him, it is you who will get the credit for that decision because you began the crossing, and Cyrus will not only feel grateful to you, regarding you as the most zealous in his cause, but he will return the favour—-	['εἰς']	1	['εἰς']	['AuxP']
248	294	1.5.3	πρέπει μὲν τὰ ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ γιγνόμενα γνώμης εἶναι ἔργα .		for it would distance him at once in its flight, not merely plying its feet, but hoisting its wings and using them like a sail.	['μέν', 'ἔργον']	2	['μὲν', 'ἔργα']	['AuxY', 'SBJ']
249	319	1.5.10	οἳ πρῶτον μὲν μόνον τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον ὀρθὸν ἀνέστησαν ·		Here the soldiers made purchases of provisions, crossing the river on rafts in the following way:	['ἄνθρωπος', 'μέν']	2	['ἄνθρωπον', 'μὲν']	['OBJ', 'AuxY']
250	331	1.5.13	ἀλλ’ ὅταν τί ποιήσωσι , νομιεῖς αὐτοὺς σοῦ φροντίζειν ;		Clearchus escaped to his own army and at once called his troops to arms;	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλ’']	['AuxY']
251	398	1.7.4	καὶ μέγα νομίζομεν κέρδος , ἐὰν ἀλλήλοις φίλοι γιγνώμεθα .		Our enemies have great numbers and they will come on with a great outcry;	['φίλος']	1	['φίλοι']	['PNOM']
252	488	1.8.20	ἆρα οὐ τὴν μὲν λαγνείαν αὐτῶν τῷ λιμῷ σωφρονίζουσι ;		one fellow, to be sure, was caught, like a befuddled man on a race-course.	['μέν', 'οὐ']	2	['μὲν', 'οὐ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
253	502	1.8.27	τὴν μὲν γὰρ κακότητα καὶ ἰλαδὸν ἔστιν ἑλέσθαι ῥηιδίως ·		For he was with him;	['μέν', 'γάρ']	2	['μὲν', 'γὰρ']	['AuxY', 'AuxY']
254	520	1.9.7	πανταχόθεν γὰρ ὠφελεῖσθαι τοῖς ἐμοὶ συνοῦσιν ἐξουσίαν ἐγὼ παρέχω .		Again, when he was sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia, Greater Phrygia, and Cappadocia and was also appointed commander of all the troops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of Castolus, he showed, in the first place, that he counted it of the utmost importance, when he concluded a treaty or compact with anyone or made anyone any promise, under no circumstances to prove false to his word.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
255	563	1.9.29	οὐκοῦν δοκοῦσί σοι ἐν τοῖς ἀδίκοις καταλογίζεσθαι τοὺς ἀχαρίστους ;		on the other hand, many went over from the King to Cyrus after the two had become enemies (these being, moreover, the men who were most highly regarded by the King), because they thought that if they were deserving, they would gain a worthier reward with Cyrus than with the King.	['ἐν']	1	['ἐν']	['AuxP']
292	30	1.1.10	τοὺς τὰ τοιαῦτα παρὰ τῶν θεῶν πυνθανομένους ἀθέμιτα ποιεῖν ἡγεῖτο .		Again, Aristippus the Thessalian chanced to be a friend of Cyrus, and since he was hard pressed by his political opponents at home, he came to Cyrus and asked him for three months’ pay for two thousand mercenaries, urging that in this way he should get the better of his opponents.	['παρά']	1	['παρὰ']	['AuxP']
293	33	1.1.11	ἀλλὰ μὴν ἐκεῖνός γε ἀεὶ μὲν ἦν ἐν τῷ φανερῷ ·		Furthermore, Cyrus directed Proxenus the Boeotian, who was a friend of his, to come to him with as many men as he could get, saying that he wished to undertake a campaign against the Pisidians, because, as he said, they were causing trouble to his province.	['ἀλλά', 'μέν', 'ἐν']	3	['ἀλλὰ', 'μὲν', 'ἐν']	['AuxY', 'AuxY', 'AuxP']
294	97	1.2.16	οὔτε γὰρ ἃ δεῖ πράττειν οὔτε ὧν δεῖ ἀπέχεσθαι δύνανται .		They marched past with their cavalry formed in troops and their infantry in companies;	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
295	102	1.2.17	αὐτὰρ ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς τοτὲ μὲν κακός , ἄλλοτε δ’ ἐσθλός .		When the trumpet sounded, they advanced arms and charged.	['ἀγαθός', 'μέν']	2	['ἀγαθὸς', 'μὲν']	['ATR', 'AuxY']
296	135	1.2.26	ἐγὼ τοίνυν , ἔφη , παρεσκεύασμαι μὲν πείθεσθαι τοῖς νόμοις ·		but Syennesis said that he had never yet put himself in the hands of anyone who was more powerful than he was, and he would not now put himself in the hands of Cyrus until his wife had won him over and he had received pledges.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
297	167	1.3.9	πότερον δὲ τ- ἀγαθὰ νομίσαν δεῖν ποιεῖν ἢ τὰ κακά ;		that is, we are no longer his soldiers, since we decline to follow him, and likewise he is no longer our paymaster.	['ἀγαθός']	1	['ἀγαθὰ']	['OBJ']
298	178	1.3.14	ἀνατίθεμαι γὰρ τὸ ὅσα τύραννος μὴ πείσας γράφει νόμον εἶναι .		One man in particular, pretending to be in a hurry to proceed back to Greece with all speed, proposed that they should choose other generals as quickly as possible, in case Clearchus did not wish to lead them back;	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
299	406	1.7.6	ἆρ’ οὐ τὰ ἔξω τῆς τέχνης μιμητέον τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς αὐλητάς ;		and all that lies between these limits my brother’s friends rule as satraps.	['ἀγαθός', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀγαθοὺς', 'οὐ']	['ATR', 'AuxZ']
300	420	1.7.11	βούλει σκοπῶμεν ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς τροφῆς ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων ·		These had been stationed in front of the King himself.	['ἀπό']	1	['ἀπὸ']	['AuxP']
301	423	1.7.12	οὐδὲ γὰρ ζῴη γ’ ἄν τις , εἰ μὴ τρέφοιτο .		For Abrocomas, marching from Phoenicia, arrived five days too late for the engagement.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
302	438	1.7.18	καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων οὐδὲν ὄφελος ἄνευ τῶν τοιούτων μαθημάτων .		however, if your prediction proves true, I promise you ten talents.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
303	546	1.9.21	ἔργον δὲ καλὸν οὔτε θεῖον οὔτ’ ἀνθρώπειον χωρὶς ἐμοῦ γίγνεται .		For, just as the precise object for which he thought he needed friends himself was that he might have co-workers, so he tried on his own part to be a most vigorous co-worker with his friends to secure that which he found each one of them desired.	['καλός', 'ἔργον']	2	['καλὸν', 'ἔργον']	['ATR', 'SBJ']
364	18	1.1.7	δῆλον οὖν ὅτι οὐκ ἂν προέλεγεν , εἰ μὴ ἐπίστευεν ἀληθεύσειν .		Cyrus thereupon took the exiles under his protection, collected an army, and laid siege to Miletus both by land and by sea, and endeavoured to restore the exiles to their city;	['δῆλος', 'οὐ']	2	['δῆλον', 'οὐκ']	['PRED/PNOM', 'AuxZ']
365	47	1.2.4	ὅσα δὲ πάντες ᾔδεσαν , οὐ θαυμαστὸν εἰ μὴ τούτων ἐνεθυμήθησαν ;		Meanwhile Tissaphernes had taken note of these proceedings and come to the conclusion that Cyrus’ preparations were too extensive to be against the Pisidians;_he accordingly made his way to the King as quickly as he could, with about five hundred horsemen.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['AuxZ']
366	78	1.2.11	τίς γὰρ ἀποκτεῖναί τινα βούλοιτ’ ἂν μᾶλλον ἢ ζῶντι πειθομένῳ χρῆσθαι ;		There he remained five days.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
367	233	1.4.8	ταῦτα δὲ πράττων πῶς οὐ μεγάλης ἄξιος ἦν τιμῆς τῇ πόλει ;		Cyrus, however, called the generals together and said:	['ἄξιος', 'οὐ']	2	['ἄξιος', 'οὐ']	['PNOM', 'AuxZ']
368	243	1.4.9	ἀλλ’ ἐνόμιζε τοὺς θεοὺς ταῖς παρὰ τῶν εὐσεβεστάτων τιμαῖς μάλιστα χαίρειν .		Such were his words;	['ἀλλά', 'παρά']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'παρὰ']	['AuxY', 'AuxP']
369	281	1.4.19	μόλις γὰρ ἂν ἴσως ἐν τοσούτῳ χρόνῳ τὸ δῆγμα ὑγιὴς γένοιο .		There they remained for three days and provisioned the army.	['ἐν', 'γάρ']	2	['ἐν', 'γὰρ']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
370	303	1.5.5	ταῦτα οὕτω προνοητικῶς πεπραγμένα ἀπορεῖς πότερα τύχης ἢ γνώμης ἔργα ἐστίν ;		In the course of these stages many of the baggage animals died of hunger.	['ἔργον']	1	['ἔργα']	['SBJ']
371	358	1.6.5	ὦ Σώκρατες , ἐγὼ μὲν ᾤμην τοὺς φιλοσοφοῦντας εὐδαιμονεστέρους χρῆναι γίγνεσθαι ·		—for it was no secret.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
372	457	1.8.9	καὶ οὐδαμῶς γε τάττω ἐμαυτὸν εἰς τὴν τῶν ἄρχειν βουλομένων τάξιν .		next to them were troops with wicker shields and, farther on, hoplites with wooden shields which reached to their feet.	['εἰς']	1	['εἰς']	['AuxP']
373	468	1.8.13	ἐν δὲ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ Σκύθαι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Μαιῶται δὲ ἄρχονται ·		Clearchus, however, since he saw the compact body at the enemy’s centre and heard from Cyrus that the King was beyond his left wing (for the King was so superior in numbers that, although occupying the centre of his own line, he was beyond Cyrus’ left wing), was unwilling to draw the right wing away from the river, for fear that he might be turned on both flanks; and he told Cyrus, in reply, that he was taking care to make everything go well.	['ἐν', 'μέν']	2	['ἐν', 'μὲν']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
374	469	1.8.14	ἐν δὲ τῇ Λιβύῃ Καρχηδόνιοι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Λίβυες δὲ ἄρχονται .		At this critical time the King’s army was advancing evenly, while the Greek force, still remaining in the same place, was forming its line from those who were still coming up.	['ἐν', 'μέν']	2	['ἐν', 'μὲν']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
375	505	1.8.29	μακρὸς δὲ καὶ ὄρθιος οἶμος ἐς αὐτὴν καὶ τρηχὺς τὸ πρῶτον ·		And one report is that the King ordered someone to slay him upon the body of Cyrus, while others say that he drew his dagger and slew himself with his own hand;	['εἰς', 'μακρός']	2	['ἐς', 'μακρὸς']	['AuxP', 'ATR']
376	530	1.9.13	ἐγὼ δὲ ῥᾳδίαν καὶ βραχεῖαν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἄξω σε .		One might often see along the travelled roads people who had lost feet or hands or eyes;	['ὁδός']	1	['ὁδὸν']	['OBJ']
377	545	1.9.20	ἐγὼ δὲ σύνειμι μὲν θεοῖς , σύνειμι δὲ ἀνθρώποις τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ·		As to friends, all agree that he showed himself pre-eminent in his attentions to all the friends that he made and found devoted to him and adjudged to be competent co-workers in whatever he might be wishing to accomplish.	['ἄνθρωπος', 'ἀγαθός', 'μέν']	3	['ἀνθρώποις', 'ἀγαθοῖς', 'μὲν']	['OBJ', 'ATR', 'AuxY']
426	15	1.1.6	καὶ τοῖς μὲν πειθομένοις αὐτῷ συνέφερε , τοῖς δὲ μὴ πειθομένοις μετέμελε .		In the first place, he sent orders to the commanders of all the garrisons he had in the cities to enlist as many Peloponnesian soldiers of the best sort as they severally could, on the plea that Tissaphernes had designs upon their cities.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
427	22	1.1.8	τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἀναγκαῖα συνεβούλευε καὶ πράττειν ὡς ἐνόμιζεν ἄριστ’ ἂν πραχθῆναι ·		Consequently he was not at all displeased at their being at war.	['ἀγαθός', 'γάρ', 'μέν']	3	['ἄριστ’', 'γὰρ', 'μὲν']	['ADV', 'AuxY', 'AuxY']
428	24	1.1.9	καὶ τοὺς μέλλοντας οἴκους τε καὶ πόλεις καλῶς οἰκήσειν μαντικῆς ἔφη προσδεῖσθαι ·		Still another army was being collected for him in the Chersonese which is opposite Abydus, in the following manner:	['καλός']	1	['καλῶς']	['ADV']

['ἀγαθός', 'ἐκ']	2	['βέλτιστα', 'ἐξ']	['ATR', 'AuxP']
504	599	1.10.16	ἢ παρεσκεύασαι μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων πειρᾶσθαι ἀρέσκειν μηδὲ πείθεσθαι μήτε στρατηγῷ μήτε ἄλλῳ ἄρχοντι ;		Then the Greeks halted, grounded arms, and proceeded to rest themselves.	['ἄνθρωπος', 'στρατηγός']	2	['ἀνθρώπων', 'στρατηγῷ']	['ATR', 'OBJ']

And never shall any man say that I, after leading Greeks into the land of the barbarians, betrayed the Greeks and chose the friendship of the barbarians. Rather, since you do not care to obey me, I shall follow with you and suffer whatever I must.	['λόγος', 'δῆλος']	2	['λόγου', 'δῆλον']	['SBJ', 'PNOM']
631	187	1.3.15	οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἄλλως ἤρεσκεν , εἴ τε προσέλθοιεν , ὑπὲρ ὧν ἡμάρτανον ἐλεγχόμενοι ἤχθοντο ·		say rather that I shall obey to the best of my ability the man whom you choose, in order that you may know that I understand as well as any other person in the world how to be a subordinate also.

632	225	1.4.5	ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ Σωκράτης τοιοῦτος ὢν ἐδόκει τιμῆς ἄξιος εἶναι τῇ πόλει μᾶλλον ἢ θανάτου .		It was because of this pass that Cyrus had sent for the fleet, in order that he might disembark hoplites between and beyond the walls and thus overpower the enemy if they should be keeping guard at the Syrian Gates—and that was precisely what Cyrus supposed Abrocomas would do, for he had a large army.	['ἄξιος', 'μέν']	2	['ἄξιος', 'μὲν']	['PNOM', 'AuxY']
633	351	1.6.3	ἢ τίς οὐκ ἂν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς δουλεύων αἰσχρῶς διατεθείη καὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὴν ψυχήν ;		The letter also contained reminders of his former friendship and fidelity.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']

692	1	1.1.1	πολλάκις ἐθαύμασα τίσι ποτὲ λόγοις Ἀθηναίους ἔπεισαν οἱ γραψάμενοι Σωκράτην ὡς ἄξιος εἴη θανάτου τῇ πόλει .		Darius and Parysatis had two sons born to them, of whom the elder was Artaxerxes and the younger Cyrus.	['ἄξιος', 'λόγος']	2	['ἄξιος', 'λόγοις']	['PNOM', 'ADV']

['ἀλλά', 'μέν']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'μὲν']	['AuxY', 'AuxY']
695	49	1.2.5	ἀλλὰ περὶ πλείονος ἐποιήσατο εὐορκεῖν ἢ χαρίσασθαι τῷ δήμῳ παρὰ τὸ δίκαιον καὶ φυλάξασθαι τοὺς ἀπειλοῦντας .		Cyrus was now setting forth from Sardis with the troops I have mentioned;	['ἀλλά', 'δίκαιος', 'παρά']	3	['ἀλλὰ', 'δίκαιον', 'παρὰ']	['AuxY', 'ADV', 'AuxP']

There is likewise a palace of the Great King in Celaenae, strongly fortified and situated at the foot of the Acropolis over the sources of the Marsyas river;	['ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'οὐ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
698	124	1.2.22	εἰ δ’ αὐτὸς σωφρονῶν διετέλει , πῶς ἂν δικαίως τῆς οὐκ ἐνούσης αὐτῷ κακίας αἰτίαν ἔχοι ;		A lofty and formidable range of mountains surrounds it on every side, from sea to sea.	['δίκαιος', 'οὐ']	2	['δικαίως', 'οὐκ']	['ADV', 'AuxZ']
699	125	1.2.23	ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ μηδὲν αὐτὸς πονηρὸν ποιῶν ἐκείνους φαῦλα πράττοντας ὁρῶν ἐπῄνει , δικαίως ἂν ἐπιτιμῷτο .		After descending he marched through this plain four stages, twenty-five parasangs, to Tarsus, a large and prosperous city of Cilicia, where the palace of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, was situated.	['ἀλλά', 'δίκαιος']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'δικαίως']	['AuxY', 'ADV']
700	156	1.3.6	οἵα μὲν οὖν ἡ συνουσία ἐγεγόνει Κριτίᾳ πρὸς Σωκράτην καὶ ὡς εἶχον πρὸς ἀλλήλους , εἴρηται .		For I consider that you are to me both fatherland and friends and allies. With you I think I shall be honoured wherever I may be, bereft of you I do not think I shall be able either to aid a friend or to ward off a foe.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
701	159	1.3.7	ἔτι γὰρ Σωκράτει συνόντες οὐκ ἄλλοις τισὶ μᾶλλον ἐπεχείρουν διαλέγεσθαι ἢ τοῖς μάλιστα πράττουσι τὰ πολιτικά .		And the soldiers—not only his own men, but the rest also—when they heard that he said he would not go on to the King’s capital, commended him.	['γάρ', 'οὐ']	2	['γὰρ', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
702	208	1.3.21	ἐκ δὲ τούτων ὀρθῶς ἂν ἔχοι τὸ ἔργον δ’ οὐδὲν ὄνειδος , ἀεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος .		but as regards the suspicion that he was leading them against the King, no one heard it expressed even then—at any rate, not openly.	['ἐκ', 'ἔργον']	2	['ἐκ', 'ἔργον']	['AuxP', 'SBJ']
703	241	1.4.8	πολλάκις γὰρ ἂν αὐτοῖς τὰ παρὰ τῶν πονηρῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν χρηστῶν εἶναι κεχαρισμένα ·		To be sure, I have their wives and children under guard in Tralles.	['γάρ', 'παρά']	2	['γὰρ', 'παρὰ']	['AuxY', 'AuxP']
704	267	1.4.15	οὐ γὰρ οὗτος , ἔφη , ἐτόλμησε τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδου υἱὸν φιλῆσαι , ὄντα εὐπροσωπότατον καὶ ὡραιότατον ;		on the other hand, if the rest vote not to follow him, we shall all go back together, but you, as the only ones who were obedient, are the men he will employ, not only for garrison duty, but for captaincies; and whatever else you may desire, I know that you, as friends of Cyrus, will secure from him.	['γάρ', 'οὐ']	2	['γὰρ', 'οὐ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
705	278	1.4.19	ἴσως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἔρωτες τοξόται διὰ τοῦτο καλοῦνται , ὅτι καὶ πρόσωθεν οἱ καλοὶ τιτρώσκουσιν .		Thence he marched through Syria nine stages, fifty parasangs.	['διά', 'καλός']	2	['διὰ', 'καλοὶ']	['AuxP', 'SBJ']
706	286	1.5.2	λέξω δὲ πρῶτον ἅ ποτε αὐτοῦ ἤκουσα περὶ τοῦ δαιμονίου διαλεγομένου πρὸς Ἀριστόδημον τὸν μικρὸν ἐπικαλούμενον .		There were besides bustards and gazelles there.	['μικρός']	1	['μικρὸν']	['PNOM']
707	314	1.5.8	ὥστε κατά γε τοῦτο ἔξεστί σοι λέγειν , ὅτι οὐδὲν γνώμῃ , ἀλλὰ τύχῃ πάντα πράττεις .		they each threw off their purple cloaks where they chanced to be standing, and rushed, as a man would run to win a victory, down a most exceedingly steep hill, wearing their costly tunics and coloured trousers, some of them, indeed, with necklaces around their necks and bracelets on their arms;	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλὰ']	['AuxY']
708	357	1.6.5	ὁ γὰρ Ἀντιφῶν ποτε βουλόμενος τοὺς συνουσιαστὰς αὐτοῦ παρελέσθαι προσελθὼν τῷ Σωκράτει παρόντων αὐτῶν ἔλεξε τάδε ·		And when he came out, he reported to his friends how Orontas’ trial was conducted	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
709	369	1.6.8	ἢ ὡς χαλεπώτερα πορίσασθαι τὰ ἐμὰ διαιτήματα τῶν σῶν διὰ τὸ σπανιώτερά τε καὶ πολυτελέστερα εἶναι ;		What wrong, then, said Cyrus, have you suffered at my hands, that you now for the third time have been found plotting against me?	['διά']	1	['διὰ']	['AuxP']
710	399	1.7.4	ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἀκούοντι ἐδόκει αὐτός τε μακάριος εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντας ἐπὶ καλοκἀγαθίαν ἄγειν .		for the rest, however, if you can hold out against these things, I am ashamed, I assure you, to think what sorry fellows you will find the people of our country to be.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
711	414	1.7.9	ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ τὸ πλούσιον καὶ τὸ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν μὴ ὄντα δοκεῖν ἀλυσιτελὲς ἀπέφαινε ·		Taking this opportunity Clearchus asked Cyrus a question like this:	['ἰσχυρός']	1	['ἰσχυρὸν']	['CO']
712	439	1.7.18	οὐκοῦν ὁ οὕτω πεπαιδευμένος ἧττον ἂν δοκεῖ σοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀντιπάλων ἢ τὰ λοιπὰ ζῷα ἁλίσκεσθαι ;		So it was this money that he then paid over, the ten days having passed.	['λοιπός']	1	['λοιπὰ']	['ATR']
713	476	1.8.16	καὶ ἰδίᾳ αὖ οἱ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ δυνατοὶ τοὺς ἀνάνδρους καὶ ἀδυνάτους οὐκ οἶσθα ὅτι καταδουλωσάμενοι καρποῦνται ;		Xenophon replied:	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
714	535	1.9.15	οὐ γὰρ διὰ τὸ πονεῖν , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ μηδὲν ἔχειν ὅ τι ποιῇς ὕπνου ἐπιθυμεῖς ·		Thus the brave were seen to be most prosperous, while cowards were deemed fit to be their slaves.	['ἀλλά', 'διά', 'γάρ', 'οὐ']	4	['ἀλλὰ', 'διὰ', 'γὰρ', 'οὐ']	['AuxY', 'AuxP', 'AuxY', 'AuxZ']
761	5	1.1.2	πρῶτον μὲν οὖν , ὡς οὐκ ἐνόμιζεν οὓς ἡ πόλις νομίζει θεούς , ποίῳ ποτ’ ἐχρήσαντο τεκμηρίῳ ;		Cyrus accordingly went up to his father, taking with him Tissaphernes as a friend and accompanied by three hundred Greek hoplites, under the command of Xenias of Parrhasia.	['μέν', 'οὐ']	2	['μὲν', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
762	28	1.1.9	τοὺς δὲ μηδὲν τῶν τοιούτων οἰομένους εἶναι δαιμόνιον , ἀλλὰ πάντα τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης γνώμης , δαιμονᾶν ἔφη ·		Consequently, the Hellespontine cities of their own free will sent Clearchus contributions of money for the support of his troops.	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλὰ']	['AuxY']
763	74	1.2.10	οὔκουν τῶν φρόνησιν ἀσκούντων τὸ βιάζεσθαι , ἀλλὰ τῶν ἰσχὺν ἄνευ γνώμης ἐχόντων τὰ τοιαῦτα πράττειν ἐστίν .		the prizes were golden strigils.	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλὰ']	['AuxY']
764	105	1.2.18	ὅταν δὲ τῶν νουθετικῶν λόγων ἐπιλάθηταί τις , ἐπιλέλησται καὶ ὧν ἡ ψυχὴ πάσχουσα τῆς σωφροσύνης ἐπεθύμει ·		Now the Cilician queen was filled with admiration at beholding the brilliant appearance and the order of the Greek army.	['λόγος']	1	['λόγων']	['ATR']
765	109	1.2.19	καὶ τὰ χρήματα καταναλώσαντες , ὧν πρόσθεν ἀπείχοντο κερδῶν , αἰσχρὰ νομίζοντες εἶναι , τούτων οὐκ ἀπέχονται .		Thence he marched through Lycaonia five stages, thirty parasangs.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
766	111	1.2.20	πάντα μὲν οὖν ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ τὰ καλὰ καὶ τ- ἀγαθὰ ἀσκητὰ εἶναι , οὐχ ἥκιστα δὲ σωφροσύνη .		From there Cyrus sent the Cilician queen back to Cilicia by the shortest route.	['ἀγαθός', 'μέν', 'οὐ', 'καλός']	4	['ἀγαθὰ', 'μὲν', 'οὐχ', 'καλὰ']	['CO', 'AuxY', 'AuxZ', 'SBJ']
767	141	1.3.1	καὶ ὁ Χαρικλῆς , ὅσουπερ , εἶπε , χρόνου βουλεύειν οὐκ ἔξεστιν , ὡς οὔπω φρονίμοις οὖσι ·		They said they had not been hired for that.	['οὐ']	1	['οὐκ']	['AuxZ']
768	210	1.4.1	δαιμόνι’ , οὔ σε ἔοικε κακὸν ὣς δειδίσσεσθαι , ἀλλ’ αὐτός τε κάθησο καὶ ἄλλους ἵδρυε λαούς .		From there he marched one stage, five parasangs, to the Pyramus river, the width of which was a stadium.	['ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'οὔ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
769	240	1.4.8	οὔτε γὰρ τοῖς θεοῖς ἔφη καλῶς ἔχειν , εἰ ταῖς μεγάλαις θυσίαις μᾶλλον ἢ ταῖς μικραῖς ἔχαιρον ·		No, let them go, with the knowledge that their behaviour toward us is worse than ours toward them.	['γάρ', 'μικρός', 'καλός']	3	['γὰρ', 'μικραῖς', 'καλῶς']	['AuxY', 'ADV/OBJ', 'ADV']
770	292	1.5.3	πολὺ νὴ Δία οἱ ζῷα , εἴπερ γε μὴ τύχῃ τινί , ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ γνώμης ταῦτα γίγνεται .		But no ostrich was captured by anyone.	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλ’']	['AuxY']
771	301	1.5.5	καὶ στόμα μέν , δι’ οὗ ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖ τὰ ζῷα εἰσπέμπεται , πλησίον ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ ῥινῶν καταθεῖναι ·		There they remained three days and provisioned the army.	['διά', 'μέν']	2	['δι’', 'μέν']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
772	325	1.5.11	τίνος γὰρ ἄλλου ζῴου ψυχὴ πρῶτα μὲν θεῶν τῶν τὰ μέγιστα καὶ κάλλιστα συνταξάντων ᾔσθηται ὅτι εἰσί ;		When his comrades heard of the matter, they took it hard and were exceedingly angry with Clearchus.	['μέν', 'γάρ', 'καλός']	3	['μὲν', 'γὰρ', 'κάλλιστα']	['AuxY', 'AuxY', 'CO']
773	336	1.5.15	ὠγαθέ , ἔφη , κατάμαθε ὅτι καὶ ὁ σὸς νοῦς ἐνὼν τὸ σὸν σῶμα ὅπως βούλεται μεταχειρίζεται .		At this moment Cyrus also came up and learned about the situation.	['ἀγαθός']	1	['ὠγαθέ']	['ExD']
774	525	1.9.10	οὐκ ἐξαπατήσω δέ σε προοιμίοις ἡδονῆς , ἀλλ’ ᾗπερ οἱ θεοὶ διέθεσαν τὰ ὄντα διηγήσομαι μετ’ ἀληθείας .		For he showed repeatedly, by deed as well as by word, that he would never abandon them when once he had come to be their friend, not even if they should become still fewer in number and should meet with still worse misfortune.	['ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
775	586	1.10.10	ἀλλὰ νὴ Δία , ἔφη , λέγει ἃ οὐκ ἄν τις ἐπὶ τῷ βίῳ παντὶ βούλοιτο ἀκοῦσαι .		And when the Greeks saw that the enemy were near them and in battle-order, they again struck up the paean and advanced to the attack much more eagerly than before;	['ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀλλὰ', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
776	597	1.10.15	ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι , εἰ τοιαύτην μὴ δύνασαι φέρειν μητέρα , τ- ἀγαθά σε οὐ δύνασθαι φέρειν .		And Lycius, after riding up and looking, brought back word that the enemy were in headlong flight.	['ἀγαθός', 'μέν', 'οὐ']	3	['ἀγαθά', 'μὲν', 'οὐ']	['OBJ', 'AuxY', 'AuxZ']
817	14	1.1.6	καὶ πολλοῖς τῶν συνόντων προηγόρευε τὰ μὲν ποιεῖν , τὰ δὲ μὴ ποιεῖν , ὡς τοῦ δαιμονίου προσημαίνοντος ·		It was in the following way, then, that he gathered this force:	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
818	26	1.1.9	τὰ δὲ μέγιστα τῶν ἐν τούτοις ἔφη τοὺς θεοὺς ἑαυτοῖς καταλείπεσθαι , ὧν οὐδὲν δῆλον εἶναι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις .		Cyrus, making his acquaintance, came to admire him, and gave him ten thousand darics.	['ἄνθρωπος', 'ἐν', 'δῆλος']	3	['ἀνθρώποις', 'ἐν', 'δῆλον']	['ADV', 'AuxP', 'PNOM']
819	46	1.2.3	ὅσα μὲν οὖν μὴ φανερὸς ἦν ὅπως ἐγίγνωσκεν , οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν ὑπὲρ τούτων περὶ αὐτοῦ παραγνῶναι τοὺς δικαστάς ·		All these came to Cyrus at Sardis.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
820	75	1.2.10	ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ συμμάχων ὁ μὲν βιάζεσθαι τολμῶν δέοιτ’ ἂν οὐκ ὀλίγων , ὁ δὲ πείθειν δυνάμενος οὐδενός ·		Cyrus himself was one of those who watched the games.	['ἀλλά', 'μέν', 'οὐ']	3	['ἀλλὰ', 'μὲν', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxY', 'AuxZ']
821	79	1.2.11	ἀλλ’ ἔφη γε ὁ κατήγορος , Σωκράτει ὁμιλητὰ γενομένω Κριτίας τε καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης πλεῖστα κακὰ τὴν πόλιν ἐποιησάτην .		At this time he was owing the soldiers more than three months’ pay, and they went again and again to his headquarters and demanded what was due them.	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλ’']	['AuxY']
822	239	1.4.8	θυσίας δὲ θύων μικρὰς ἀπὸ μικρῶν οὐδὲν ἡγεῖτο μειοῦσθαι τῶν ἀπὸ πολλῶν καὶ μεγάλων πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα θυόντων .		But for my part, I swear by the gods that I shall not pursue them, nor shall anyone say about me that I use a man so long as he is with me and then, when he wants to leave me, seize him and maltreat him and despoil him of his possessions.	['ἀπό', 'μικρός']	2	['ἀπὸ', 'μικρὰς']	['AuxP', 'ATR']
823	302	1.5.5	ἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ ἀποχωροῦντα δυσχερῆ , ἀποστρέψαι τοὺς τούτων ὀχετοὺς καὶ ἀπενεγκεῖν ᾗ δυνατὸν προσωτάτω ἀπὸ τῶν αἰσθήσεων ·		Thence Cyrus marched thirteen stages through desert country, ninety parasangs, keeping the Euphrates river on the right, and arrived at Pylae.	['ἀπό']	1	['ἀπὸ']	['AuxP']
824	317	1.5.9	εὖ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὅτι , εἰ νομίζοιμι θεοὺς ἀνθρώπων τι φροντίζειν , οὐκ ἂν ἀμελοίην αὐτῶν .		Furthermore, one who observed closely could see at a glance that while the King’s empire was strong in its extent of territory and number of inhabitants, it was weak by reason of the greatness of the distances and the scattered condition of its forces, in case one should be swift in making his attack upon it.	['ἄνθρωπος', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀνθρώπων', 'οὐκ']	['ATR', 'AuxZ']
825	346	1.6.1	ἀλλὰ μὴν εἴ γε μηδὲ δοῦλον ἀκρατῆ δεξαίμεθ’ ἄν , πῶς οὐκ ἄξιον αὐτόν γε φυλάξασθαι τοιοῦτον γενέσθαι ;		At this time Orontas, a Persian, who was related to the King by birth and was reckoned among the best of the Persians in matters of war, devised a plot against Cyrus—in fact, he had made war upon him before this, but had become his friend again.	['ἄξιος', 'ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	3	['ἄξιον', 'ἀλλὰ', 'οὐκ']	['PNOM', 'AuxY', 'AuxZ']
826	368	1.6.7	ἢ τὴν δίαιτάν μου φαυλίζεις ὡς ἧττον μὲν ὑγιεινὰ ἐσθίοντος ἐμοῦ ἢ σοῦ , ἧττον δὲ ἰσχὺν παρέχοντα ;		This also Orontas admitted.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
827	486	1.8.20	τίς γὰρ ἂν ἐθέλοι ἄνθρωπον ἐν οἰκίᾳ ἔχειν πονεῖν μὲν μηδὲν ἐθέλοντα , τῇ δὲ πολυτελεστάτῃ διαίτῃ χαίροντα ;		As for the enemy’s chariots, some of them plunged through the lines of their own troops, others, however, through the Greek lines, but without charioteers.	['οἰκία', 'ἐν', 'μέν', 'γάρ', 'ἄνθρωπος']	5	['οἰκίᾳ', 'ἐν', 'μὲν', 'γὰρ', 'ἄνθρωπον']	['ADV', 'AuxP', 'AuxY', 'AuxY', 'SBJ']
828	529	1.9.13	ἐννοεῖς , ὦ Ἡράκλεις , ὡς χαλεπὴν καὶ μακρὰν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὰς εὐφροσύνας ἡ γυνή σοι αὕτη διηγεῖται ;		Yet, on the other hand, none could say that he permitted malefactors and wicked men to laugh at him; on the contrary, he was merciless to the last degree in punishing them.	['ὁδός', 'μακρός']	2	['ὁδὸν', 'μακρὰν']	['OBJ', 'CO']
829	537	1.9.16	οὕτω γὰρ παιδεύεις τοὺς σεαυτῆς φίλους , τῆς μὲν νυκτὸς ὑβρίζουσα , τῆς δ’ ἡμέρας τὸ χρησιμώτατον κατακοιμίζουσα .		As for uprightness, if a man showed that he desired to distinguish himself in that quality, Cyrus considered it all important to enable such an one to live in greater opulence than those who were greedy of unjust gain.	['φίλος', 'μέν', 'γάρ', 'ἡμέρα']	4	['φίλους', 'μὲν', 'γὰρ', 'ἡμέρας']	['OBJ', 'AuxY', 'AuxY', 'ATR']
830	551	1.9.24	καὶ οἱ μὲν νέοι τοῖς τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἐπαίνοις χαίρουσιν , οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ταῖς τῶν νέων τιμαῖς ἀγάλλονται ·		but that he surpassed them in solicitude and in eagerness to do favours, this in my opinion is more admirable.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
831	606	1.10.18	εἶτα τούτων μὲν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι παρεσκεύασαι , τὴν δὲ μητέρα τὴν πάντων μάλιστά σε φιλοῦσαν οὐκ οἴει δεῖν θεραπεύειν ;		They found most of their property pillaged, in particular whatever there was to eat or drink, and as for the wagons loaded with flour and wine which Cyrus had provided in order that, if ever serious need should overtake the army, he might have supplies to distribute among the Greeks (and there were four hundred of these wagons, it was said), these also the King and his men had now pillaged.	['μέν', 'οὐ']	2	['μὲν', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']
832	610	1.10.19	εἰ γάρ σε ὑπολάβοιεν πρὸς τοὺς γονέας ἀχάριστον εἶναι , οὐδεὶς ἂν νομίσειεν εὖ σε ποιήσας χάριν ἀπολήψεσθαι .		Thus it was, then that they got through this night.	['γάρ']	1	['γάρ']	['AuxY']
864	59	1.2.7	τὸ μὲν οὖν ὑπερεσθίοντα ὑπερπονεῖν ἀπεδοκίμαζε , τὸ δὲ ὅσα ἡδέως ἡ ψυχὴ δέχεται , ταῦτα ἱκανῶς ἐκπονεῖν ἐδοκίμαζε ·		its sources are beneath the palace.	['μέν']	1	['μὲν']	['AuxY']
865	91	1.2.14	πάντας δὲ τοὺς διδάσκοντας ὁρῶ αὑτοὺς δεικνύντας τε τοῖς μανθάνουσιν ᾗπερ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσιν ἃ διδάσκουσι καὶ τῷ λόγῳ προσβιβάζοντας .		And the Cilician queen, as the report ran, asked Cyrus to exhibit his army to her.	['λόγος']	1	['λόγῳ']	['ADV']
866	165	1.3.9	ἀλλ’ οὐδέν τι χαλεποῦ πράγματος ἐπιθυμεῖς , ὦ Ἀλκιβιάδη , φάναι τὸν Περικλέα , βουλόμενος γνῶναι τί ἐστι νόμος ·		After this Clearchus gathered together his own soldiers, those who had come over to him, and any others who wanted to be present, and spoke as follows:	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλ’']	['AuxY']
867	196	1.3.19	ἔφη δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν φίλων αὐτὸν λέγειν ὡς οὐδὲν ὄφελος εὔνους εἶναι , εἰ μὴ καὶ ὠφελεῖν δυνήσονται ·		If, however, his enterprise is found to be greater and more laborious and more dangerous than the former one, we ought to demand that he should either offer sufficient persuasion and lead us on with him, or yield to our persuasion and let us go home in friendship;	['φίλος']	1	['φίλων']	['ADV']
868	199	1.3.19	ἐγὼ δ’ αὐτὸν οἶδα μὲν καὶ περὶ πατέρων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συγγενῶν τε καὶ περὶ φίλων ταῦτα λέγοντα ·		and that we after hearing it should deliberate about the matter.	['φίλος', 'μέν']	2	['φίλων', 'μὲν']	['CO', 'AuxY']
869	220	1.4.4	ὧν τινες μικρὰ μέρη παρ’ ἐκείνου προῖκα λαβόντες πολλοῦ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπώλουν , καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνος δημοτικοί ·		And in the space between these walls flows a river named the Carsus, a plethrum in width.	['μικρός', 'οὐ', 'παρά']	3	['μικρὰ', 'οὐκ', 'παρ’']	['ATR', 'AuxZ', 'AuxP']
870	237	1.4.8	καὶ ηὔχετο δὲ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ἁπλῶς τ- ἀγαθὰ διδόναι , ὡς τοὺς θεοὺς κάλλιστα εἰδότας ὁποῖα ἀγαθά ἐστι ·		Nor have they fled beyond my power.	['ἀγαθός', 'καλός']	2	['ἀγαθὰ', 'κάλλιστα']	['OBJ', 'ADV']
871	300	1.5.4	καὶ τοὺς μὲν πρόσθεν ὀδόντας πᾶσι ζῴοις οἵους τέμνειν εἶναι , τοὺς δὲ γομφίους οἵους παρὰ τούτων δεξαμένους λεαίνειν ·		It was completely surrounded by the Mascas.	['μέν', 'παρά']	2	['μὲν', 'παρὰ']	['AuxY', 'AuxP']
872	362	1.6.6	καὶ μὴν χρήματά γε οὐ λαμβάνεις , ἃ καὶ κτωμένους εὐφραίνει καὶ κεκτημένους ἐλευθεριώτερόν τε καὶ ἥδιον ποιεῖ ζῆν .		then, at the bidding, as he himself said, of my brother, this man levied war upon me, holding the citadel of Sardis, and I, by the war I waged against him, made him count it best to cease from warring upon me, and I received and gave the hand-clasp of friendship. Since that, he said, Orontas, have I done you any wrong?	['οὐ']	1	['οὐ']	['AuxZ']
873	405	1.7.6	ἐνθυμώμεθα γάρ , ἔφη , εἴ τις μὴ ὢν ἀγαθὸς αὐλητὴς δοκεῖν βούλοιτο , τί ἂν αὐτῷ ποιητέον εἴη .		Well, gentlemen, my father’s realm extends toward the south to a region where men cannot dwell by reason of the heat, and to the north to a region where they cannot dwell by reason of the cold;	['ἀγαθός', 'γάρ']	2	['ἀγαθὸς', 'γάρ']	['ATR', 'AuxY']
874	407	1.7.7	καὶ πρῶτον μέν , ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι σκεύη τε καλὰ κέκτηνται καὶ ἀκολούθους πολλοὺς περιάγονται , καὶ τούτῳ ταῦτα ποιητέον ·		Now if we win the victory, we must put our friends in control of these provinces.	['μέν', 'καλός']	2	['μέν', 'καλὰ']	['AuxY', 'ATR']
875	411	1.7.8	ὣς δ’ αὔτως εἴ τις βούλοιτο στρατηγὸς ἀγαθὸς μὴ ὢν φαίνεσθαι ἢ κυβερνήτης , ἐννοῶμεν τί ἂν αὐτῷ συμβαίνοι .		Then some of the others also sought Cyrus’ presence, demanding to know what they should have, in case of victory;	['ἀγαθός', 'στρατηγός']	2	['ἀγαθὸς', 'στρατηγὸς']	['ATR', 'PNOM']
876	582	1.10.8	ἀλλά τοι εἰ καὶ πάντα ταῦτα πεποίηκε καὶ ἄλλα τούτων πολλαπλάσια , οὐδεὶς ἂν δύναιτο αὐτῆς ἀνασχέσθαι τὴν χαλεπότητα .		At any rate, after Tissaphernes had thus come off with the worst of it, he did not wheel round again, but went on to the camp of the Greeks and there fell in with the King; so it was that, after forming their lines once more, they were proceeding together.	['ἀλλά']	1	['ἀλλά']	['AuxY']
911	56	1.2.7	ἀλλ’ ἔπαυσε μὲν τούτων πολλοὺς ἀρετῆς ποιήσας ἐπιθυμεῖν καὶ ἐλπίδας παρασχών , ἂν ἑαυτῶν ἐπιμελῶνται , καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς ἔσεσθαι ·		Thence he marched three stages, twenty parasangs, to Celaenae, an inhabited city of Phrygia, large and prosperous.	['ἀλλά', 'ἀγαθός', 'μέν', 'καλός']	4	['ἀλλ’', 'ἀγαθοὺς', 'μὲν', 'καλοὺς']	['AuxY', 'CO', 'AuxY', 'PNOM']
912	88	1.2.13	ὡς γὰρ τάχιστα κρείττονε τῶν συγγιγνομένων ἡγησάσθην εἶναι , εὐθὺς ἀποπηδήσαντε Σωκράτους ἐπραττέτην τὰ πολιτικά , ὧνπερ ἕνεκα Σωκράτους ὠρεχθήτην .		There, alongside the road, was the so-called spring of Midas, the king of the Phrygians, at which Midas, according to the story, caught the satyr by mixing wine with the water of the spring.	['γάρ']	1	['γὰρ']	['AuxY']
913	113	1.2.20	καὶ Κριτίας δὴ καὶ Ἀλκιβιάδης , ἕως μὲν Σωκράτει συνήστην , ἐδυνάσθην ἐκείνῳ χρωμένω συμμάχῳ τῶν μὴ καλῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν κρατεῖν ·		With the rest of the army Cyrus marched through Cappadocia four stages, twenty-five parasangs, to Dana, an inhabited city, large and prosperous.	['μέν', 'καλός']	2	['μὲν', 'καλῶν']	['AuxY', 'ATR']
914	121	1.2.22	ἀλλ’ οἵ γε πατέρες αὐτοὶ συνόντες τοῖς υἱέσι , τῶν παίδων πλημμελούντων , οὐκ αἰτίαν ἔχουσιν , ἐὰν αὐτοὶ σωφρονῶσιν .		At any rate  Cyrus climbed the mountains without meeting any opposition, and saw the camp where the Cilicians had been keeping guard.	['ἀλλά', 'οὐ']	2	['ἀλλ’', 'οὐκ']	['AuxY', 'AuxZ']

['ἀλλά', 'καλός']	2	['ἀλλὰ', 'καλὸν']	['AuxY', 'PNOM']
921	276	1.4.18	ὦ μῶρε , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , τοὺς δὲ καλοὺς οὐκ οἴει φιλοῦντας ἐνιέναι τι , ὅτι σὺ οὐχ ὁρᾷς ·		The people of Thapsacus said that this river had never been passable on foot except at this time, but only by boats; and these Abrocomas had now burned, as he marched on ahead of Cyrus, in order to prevent him from crossing.

922	293	1.5.3	τῶν δὲ ἀτεκμάρτως ἐχόντων ὅτου ἕνεκα ἔστι καὶ τῶν φανερῶς ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ ὄντων πότερα τύχης καὶ πότερα γνώμης ἔργα κρίνεις ;		Any horseman who chased one speedily desisted;	['ἔργον']	1	['ἔργα']	['OBJ']

970	471	1.8.15	ἢ τῶν Ἑλλήνων , ἐν οἷς καὶ αὐτὸς εἶ , πότερά σοι δοκοῦσιν ἥδιον οἱ κρατοῦντες ἢ οἱ κρατούμενοι , ζῆν ;		Then Xenophon, an Athenian, seeing him from the Greek army, approached so as to meet him and asked if he had any orders to give;	['ἐν']	1	['ἐν']	['AuxP']

To be sure, the fact that he outdid his friends in the greatness of the benefits he conferred is nothing surprising, for the manifest reason that he had greater means than they;	['διά']	1	['διὰ']	['AuxP']
975	553	1.9.25	ὅταν δ’ ἔλθῃ τὸ πεπρωμένον τέλος , οὐ μετὰ λήθης ἄτιμοι κεῖνται , ἀλλὰ μετὰ μνήμης τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον ὑμνούμενοι θάλλουσι .		Cyrus says that he has not chanced upon better wine than this for a long time; so he sends it to you, and asks you to drink it up today in company with the friends you love best.

1013	203	1.3.20	καὶ τὸ σίαλον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἀποπτύουσιν ὡς δύνανται πορρωτάτω , διότι ὠφελεῖ μὲν οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς ἐνόν , βλάπτει δὲ πολὺ μᾶλλον .
