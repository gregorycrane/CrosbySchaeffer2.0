1604	223	1.4.4	ἦν γὰρ ἡ πάροδος στενὴ καὶ τὰ τείχη εἰς τὴν θάλατταν καθήκοντα , ὕπερθεν δ’ ἦσαν πέτραι ἠλίβατοι ·		or the pass was narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and above the pass were precipitous rocks.	['γάρ', 'εἰς']	2	['γὰρ', 'εἰς']	['AuxY', 'AuxP']
1605	227	1.4.6	ἐντεῦθεν ἐξελαύνει διὰ Συρίας σταθμὸν ἕνα παρασάγγας πέντε εἰς Μυρίανδον , πόλιν οἰκουμένην ὑπὸ Φοινίκων ἐπὶ τῇ θαλάττῃ ·		Thence Cyrus marched one stage, five parasangs, to Myriandus, a city on the sea coast, inhabited by Phoenicians;	['εἰς', 'ἐντεῦθεν', 'διά']	3	['εἰς', 'ἐντεῦθεν', 'διὰ']	['AuxP', 'ADV', 'AuxP']
1606	282	1.5.1	ἐντεῦθεν ἐξελαύνει διὰ τῆς Ἀραβίας τὸν Εὐφράτην ποταμὸν ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχων σταθμοὺς ἐρήμους πέντε παρασάγγας τριάκοντα καὶ πέντε .		Thence he marched through Arabia, keeping the Euphrates on the right, five stages through desert country, thirty-five parasangs.

1608	285	1.5.2	δένδρον δ’ οὐδὲν ἐνῆν , θηρία δὲ παντοῖα , πλεῖστοι ὄνοι ἄγριοι , πολλαὶ δὲ στρουθοὶ αἱ μεγάλαι ·		trees there were none, but wild animals of all sorts, vast numbers of wild asses and many ostriches.	['δένδρον']	1	['δένδρον']	['SBJ']
1609	294	1.5.3	πολὺ γὰρ ἀπέσπα φεύγουσα , τοῖς μὲν ποσὶ δρόμῳ , ταῖς δὲ πτέρυξιν αἴρουσα , ὥσπερ ἱστίῳ χρωμένη .		for it would distance him at once in its flight, not merely plying its feet, but hoisting its wings and using them like a sail.	['μέν', 'γάρ']	2	['μὲν', 'γὰρ']	['AuxY', 'AuxY']
1610	302	1.5.5	ἐντεῦθεν ἐξελαύνει σταθμοὺς ἐρήμους τρισκαίδεκα παρασάγγας ἐνενήκοντα τὸν Εὐφράτην ποταμὸν ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχων , καὶ ἀφικνεῖται ἐπὶ Πύλας .		Thence Cyrus marched thirteen stages through desert country, ninety parasangs, keeping the Euphrates river on the right, and arrived at Pylae.

1611	315	1.5.8	εὐθὺς δὲ σὺν τούτοις εἰσπηδήσαντες εἰς τὸν πηλὸν θᾶττον ἢ ὥς τις ἂν ᾤετο μετεώρους ἐξεκόμισαν τὰς ἁμάξας .		and leaping at once, with all this finery, into the mud, they lifted the wagons high and dry and brought them out more quickly than one would have thought possible.	['εἰς']	1	['εἰς']	['AuxP']
1612	318	1.5.10	πέραν δὲ τοῦ Εὐφράτου ποταμοῦ κατὰ τοὺς ἐρήμους σταθμοὺς ἦν πόλις εὐδαίμων καὶ μεγάλη , ὄνομα δὲ Χαρμάνδη ·		Across the Euphrates river in the course of these desert marches was a large and prosperous city named Charmande.	['ποταμός']	1	['ποταμοῦ']	['APOS']
1613	348	1.6.2	τῷ δὲ Κύρῳ ἀκούσαντι ταῦτα ἐδόκει ὠφέλιμα εἶναι , καὶ ἐκέλευεν αὐτὸν λαμβάνειν μέρος παρ’ ἑκάστου τῶν ἡγεμόνων .		When Cyrus heard this plan, it seemed to him to be an expedient one, and he directed Orontas to get a detachment from each one of the cavalry commanders.	['παρά']	1	['παρ’']	['AuxP']
1614	425	1.7.14	ἐντεῦθεν δὲ Κῦρος ἐξελαύνει σταθμὸν ἕνα παρασάγγας τρεῖς συντεταγμένῳ τῷ στρατεύματι παντὶ καὶ τῷ Ἑλληνικῷ καὶ τῷ βαρβαρικῷ ·		From there Cyrus marched one stage, three parasangs, with his whole army, Greek and barbarian alike, drawn up in line of battle;	['ἐντεῦθεν']	1	['ἐντεῦθεν']	['ADV']
1615	432	1.7.15	ἦν δὲ παρὰ τὸν Εὐφράτην πάροδος στενὴ μεταξὺ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ τῆς τάφρου ὡς εἴκοσι ποδῶν τὸ εὖρος ·		And alongside the Euphrates there was a narrow passage, not more than about twenty feet in width, between the river and the trench;	['παρά', 'ποταμός']	2	['παρὰ', 'ποταμοῦ']	['AuxP', 'ATR']
1616	494	1.8.23	ἐπεὶ δ’ οὐδεὶς αὐτῷ ἐμάχετο ἐκ τοῦ ἀντίου οὐδὲ τοῖς αὐτοῦ τεταγμένοις ἔμπροσθεν , ἐπέκαμπτεν ὡς εἰς κύκλωσιν .		Since, then, there was no one in his front to give battle to him or to the troops drawn up before him, he proceeded to wheel round his line with the intention of encircling the enemy.	['ἐκ', 'εἰς']	2	['ἐκ', 'εἰς']	['AuxP', 'AuxP']
1617	505	1.8.29	καὶ οἱ μέν φασι βασιλέα κελεῦσαί τινα ἐπισφάξαι αὐτὸν Κύρῳ , οἱ δ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐπισφάξασθαι σπασάμενον τὸν ἀκινάκην ·		And one report is that the King ordered someone to slay him upon the body of Cyrus, while others say that he drew his dagger and slew himself with his own hand;	['μέν']	1	['μέν']	['AuxY']
1618	551	1.9.24	τὸ δὲ τῇ ἐπιμελείᾳ περιεῖναι τῶν φίλων καὶ τῷ προθυμεῖσθαι χαρίζεσθαι , ταῦτα ἔμοιγε μᾶλλον δοκεῖ ἀγαστὰ εἶναι .		but that he surpassed them in solicitude and in eagerness to do favours, this in my opinion is more admirable.	['φίλος']	1	['φίλων']	['OBJ']
1619	559	1.9.28	ὥστε ἐγὼ μέν γε , ἐξ ὧν ἀκούω , οὐδένα κρίνω ὑπὸ πλειόνων πεφιλῆσθαι οὔτε Ἑλλήνων οὔτε βαρβάρων .		Hence, as I at least conclude from what comes to my ears, no man, Greek or barbarian, has ever been loved by a greater number of people.	['βάρβαρος', 'ἐκ', 'μέν']	3	['βαρβάρων', 'ἐξ', 'μέν']	['CO', 'AuxP', 'AuxY']
1696	11	1.1.5	ὅστις δ’ ἀφικνεῖτο τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας οὕτω διατιθεὶς ἀπεπέμπετο ὥστε αὐτῷ μᾶλλον φίλους εἶναι ἢ βασιλεῖ .		Again, when any of the King’s court came to visit him, he treated them all in such a way that when he sent them back they were more devoted to him than to the King.	['παρά', 'φίλος']	2	['παρὰ', 'φίλους']	['AuxP', 'PNOM']
1697	21	1.1.8	ὥστε βασιλεὺς τὴν μὲν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἐπιβουλὴν οὐκ ᾐσθάνετο , Τισσαφέρνει δ’ ἐνόμιζε πολεμοῦντα αὐτὸν ἀμφὶ τὰ στρατεύματα δαπανᾶν ·		The result was that the King failed to perceive the plot against himself, but believed that Cyrus was spending money on his troops because he was at war with Tissaphernes.	['οὐ', 'μέν']	2	['οὐκ', 'μὲν']	['AuxZ', 'AuxY']
1698	127	1.2.24	ταύτην τὴν πόλιν ἐξέλιπον οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες μετὰ Συεννέσιος εἰς χωρίον ὀχυρὸν ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη πλὴν οἱ τὰ καπηλεῖα ἔχοντες ·		The inhabitants of this city had abandoned it and fled, with Syennesis, to a stronghold upon the mountains—all of them, at least, except the tavern-keepers.	['εἰς']	1	['εἰς']	['AuxP']
1699	149	1.3.3	ἐμοὶ γὰρ ξένος Κῦρος ἐγένετο καί με φεύγοντα ἐκ τῆς πατρίδος τά τε ἄλλα ἐτίμησε καὶ μυρίους ἔδωκε δαρεικούς ·		For Cyrus became my friend and not only honoured me, an exile from my fatherland, in various ways, but gave me ten thousand darics.	['ἐκ', 'γάρ']	2	['ἐκ', 'γὰρ']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
1700	159	1.3.7	οἱ δὲ στρατιῶται οἵ τε αὐτοῦ ἐκείνου καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ταῦτα ἀκούσαντες ὅτι οὐ φαίη παρὰ βασιλέα πορεύεσθαι ἐπῄνεσαν ·		And the soldiers—not only his own men, but the rest also—when they heard that he said he would not go on to the King’s capital, commended him.	['παρά', 'οὐ']	2	['παρὰ', 'οὐ']	['AuxP', 'AuxZ']
1701	264	1.4.14	ἐγὼ οὖν φημι ὑμᾶς χρῆναι διαβῆναι τὸν Εὐφράτην ποταμὸν πρὶν δῆλον εἶναι ὅ τι οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες ἀποκρινοῦνται Κύρῳ .		My own plan, then, is that you should cross the Euphrates river before it is clear what answer the rest of the Greeks will make to Cyrus.	['δῆλος', 'ποταμός']	2	['δῆλον', 'ποταμὸν']	['PNOM', 'APOS']
1702	272	1.4.17	οἱ μὲν δὴ στρατιῶται ἐν ἐλπίσι μεγάλαις ὄντες ηὔχοντο αὐτὸν εὐτυχῆσαι , Μένωνι δὲ καὶ δῶρα ἐλέγετο πέμψαι μεγαλοπρεπῶς .		So Menon’s troops cherished high hopes and prayed that he might be successful, while to Menon himself Cyrus was said to have sent magnificent gifts besides.	['ἐν', 'δῶρον', 'μέν']	3	['ἐν', 'δῶρα', 'μὲν']	['AuxP', 'CO', 'AuxY']
1703	310	1.5.7	ἦν δὲ τούτων τῶν σταθμῶν οὓς πάνυ μακροὺς ἤλαυνεν , ὁπότε ἢ πρὸς ὕδωρ βούλοιτο διατελέσαι ἢ πρὸς χιλόν .		And Cyrus sometimes made these stages through the desert very long, whenever he wanted to reach water or fresh fodder.	['μακρός']	1	['μακροὺς']	['ATR']
1704	312	1.5.8	ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐδόκουν αὐτῷ σχολαίως ποιεῖν , ὥσπερ ὀργῇ ἐκέλευσε τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν Πέρσας τοὺς κρατίστους συνεπισπεῦσαι τὰς ἁμάξας .		But it seemed to him that they took their time with the work; accordingly, as if in anger, he directed the Persian nobles who accompanied him to take a hand in hurrying on the wagons.	['ἀγαθός']	1	['κρατίστους']	['SBJ']
1705	389	1.7.1	ἐν δὲ τῷ τρίτῳ σταθμῷ Κῦρος ἐξέτασιν ποιεῖται τῶν Ἑλλήνων καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ περὶ μέσας νύκτας ·		On the third stage he held a review of the Greeks and the barbarians on the plain at about midnight.	['βάρβαρος', 'ἐν', 'πεδίον']	3	['βαρβάρων', 'ἐν', 'πεδίῳ']	['CO', 'AuxP', 'ADV']
1706	392	1.7.2	μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐξέτασιν ἅμα τῇ ἐπιούσῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἥκοντες αὐτόμολοι παρὰ μεγάλου βασιλέως ἀπήγγελλον Κύρῳ περὶ τῆς βασιλέως στρατιᾶς .		On the morning following the review, at daybreak, there came deserters from the great King and brought reports to Cyrus about his army.	['στρατιά', 'παρά', 'ἡμέρα']	3	['στρατιᾶς', 'παρὰ', 'ἡμέρᾳ']	['ADV', 'AuxP', 'ADV']
1707	430	1.7.15	εἰσὶ δὲ τέτταρες , τὸ μὲν εὖρος πλεθριαῖαι , βαθεῖαι δὲ ἰσχυρῶς , καὶ πλοῖα πλεῖ ἐν αὐταῖς σιταγωγά ·		they are four in number, each a plethrum wide and exceedingly deep, and grain-carrying ships ply in them;	['ἰσχυρός', 'ἐν', 'μέν']	3	['ἰσχυρῶς', 'ἐν', 'μὲν']	['ADV', 'AuxP', 'AuxY']
1708	435	1.7.17	ταύτῃ μὲν οὖν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ οὐκ ἐμαχέσατο βασιλεύς , ἀλλ’ ὑποχωρούντων φανερὰ ἦσαν καὶ ἵππων καὶ ἀνθρώπων ἴχνη πολλά .		Now on that day the King did not offer battle, but tracks of both horses and men in retreat were to be seen in great numbers.

And Cyrus, riding along at some distance from his army, was taking a survey, looking in either direction, both at his enemies and his friends.	['οὐ', 'πολέμιος', 'φίλος', 'εἰς']	4	['οὐ', 'πολεμίους', 'φίλους', 'εἴς']	['AuxZ', 'OBJ', 'CO', 'AuxP']
1710	486	1.8.20	τὰ δ’ ἅρματα ἐφέροντο τὰ μὲν δι’ αὐτῶν τῶν πολεμίων , τὰ δὲ καὶ διὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων κενὰ ἡνιόχων .		As for the enemy’s chariots, some of them plunged through the lines of their own troops, others, however, through the Greek lines, but without charioteers.	['πολέμιος', 'μέν', 'διά']	3	['πολεμίων', 'μὲν', 'δι’']	['ADV', 'AuxY', 'AuxP']
1711	516	1.9.5	ἔκρινον δ’ αὐτὸν καὶ τῶν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον ἔργων , τοξικῆς τε καὶ ἀκοντίσεως , φιλομαθέστατον εἶναι καὶ μελετηρότατον .		he was also adjudged the most eager to learn, and the most diligent in practising, military accomplishments, alike the use of the bow and of the javelin.	['εἰς', 'ἔργον', 'πόλεμος']	3	['εἰς', 'ἔργων', 'πόλεμον']	['AuxP', 'ADV', 'ATR']
1712	550	1.9.24	καὶ τὸ μὲν τὰ μεγάλα νικᾶν τοὺς φίλους εὖ ποιοῦντα οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν , ἐπειδή γε καὶ δυνατώτερος ἦν ἐστι ·		To be sure, the fact that he outdid his friends in the greatness of the benefits he conferred is nothing surprising, for the manifest reason that he had greater means than they;	['φίλος', 'μέν']	2	['φίλους', 'μὲν']	['OBJ', 'AuxY']
1713	558	1.9.28	εἰ δὲ δή ποτε πορεύοιτο καὶ πλεῖστοι μέλλοιεν ὄψεσθαι , προσκαλῶν τοὺς φίλους ἐσπουδαιολογεῖτο , ὡς δηλοίη οὓς τιμᾷ .		And whenever he was on the march and was likely to be seen by very many people, he would call his friends to him and engage them in earnest conversation, in order to show whom he honoured.	['φίλος']	1	['φίλους']	['OBJ']
1714	570	1.10.1	καὶ οἱ μὲν μετὰ Ἀριαίου οὐκέτι ἵστανται , ἀλλὰ φεύγουσι διὰ τοῦ αὑτῶν στρατοπέδου εἰς τὸν σταθμὸν ἔνθεν ὡρμῶντο ·		and Ariaeus and his men no longer stood their ground, but fled through their own camp to the stopping-place from which they had set out that morning.

The people of Miletus also were planning to do the very same thing, namely, to go over to Cyrus, but Tissaphernes, finding out about it in time, put some of them to death and banished others.	['ἐν', 'μέν']	2	['ἐν', 'μὲν']	['AuxP', 'AuxY']
1777	36	1.2.1	ἐπεὶ δ’ ἐδόκει ἤδη πορεύεσθαι αὐτῷ ἄνω , τὴν μὲν πρόφασιν ἐποιεῖτο ὡς Πισίδας βουλόμενος ἐκβαλεῖν παντάπασιν ἐκ τῆς χώρας ·		When he thought the time had come to begin his upward march, the pretext he offered was that he wished to drive the Pisidians out of his land entirely.

1778	93	1.2.15	ἐκέλευσε δὲ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ὡς νόμος αὐτοῖς εἰς μάχην οὕτω ταχθῆναι καὶ στῆναι , συντάξαι δ’ ἕκαστον τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ . ἐστι		He ordered the Greeks to form their lines and take their positions just as they were accustomed to do for battle, each general marshalling his own men.

1779	154	1.3.5	εἰ μὲν δὴ δίκαια ποιήσω οὐκ οἶδα , αἱρήσομαι δ’ οὖν ὑμᾶς καὶ σὺν ὑμῖν ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ πείσομαι .

['παρά', 'ποταμός', 'εἰς']	3	['παρὰ', 'ποταμὸν', 'εἰς']	['AuxP', 'OBJ', 'AuxP']
1781	399	1.7.4	ἂν δὲ ταῦτα ἀνάσχησθε , τὰ ἄλλα καὶ αἰσχύνεσθαί μοι δοκῶ οἵους ἡμῖν γνώσεσθε τοὺς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ὄντας ἀνθρώπους .		for the rest, however, if you can hold out against these things, I am ashamed, I assure you, to think what sorry fellows you will find the people of our country to be.

1782	411	1.7.8	εἰσῇσαν δὲ παρ’ αὐτὸν οἵ τε στρατηγοὶ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Ἑλλήνων τινὲς ἀξιοῦντες εἰδέναι τί σφίσιν ἔσται , ἐὰν κρατήσωσιν .		Then some of the others also sought Cyrus’ presence, demanding to know what they should have, in case of victory;	['παρά', 'στρατηγός']	2	['παρ’', 'στρατηγοὶ']	['AuxP', 'SBJ']
1783	548	1.9.22	ταῦτα δὲ πάντων δὴ μάλιστα τοῖς φίλοις διεδίδου , πρὸς τοὺς τρόπους ἑκάστου σκοπῶν καὶ ὅτου μάλιστα ὁρῴη ἕκαστον δεόμενον .		and surely he of all men distributed gifts most generously among his friends, with an eye to the tastes of each one and to whatever particular need he noted in each case.

When Darius had died and Artaxerxes had become established as king, Tissaphernes falsely accused Cyrus to his brother of plotting against him.	['ἀδελφός', 'εἰς']	2	['ἀδελφὸν', 'εἰς']	['OBJ', 'AuxP']

At this time Orontas, a Persian, who was related to the King by birth and was reckoned among the best of the Persians in matters of war, devised a plot against Cyrus—in fact, he had made war upon him before this, but had become his friend again.

Furthermore, Cyrus directed Proxenus the Boeotian, who was a friend of his, to come to him with as many men as he could get, saying that he wished to undertake a campaign against the Pisidians, because, as he said, they were causing trouble to his province.

But as for Menon, before it was clear what the rest of the soldiers would do, that is, whether they would follow Cyrus or not, he gathered together his own troops apart from the others and spoke as follows:	['δῆλος', 'οὐ']	2	['δῆλον', 'οὔ']	['PNOM', 'CO/AuxZ']

But when they turned to flight, Cyrus’ six hundred, setting out in pursuit, became scattered also, and only a very few were left about him, chiefly his so-called table companions.

Furthermore, what happened to Cyrus at the end of his life is a strong indication that he was a true man himself and that he knew how to judge those who were faithful, devoted, and constant.

2412	509	1.9.1	Κῦρος μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἐτελεύτησεν , ἀνὴρ ὢν Περσῶν τῶν μετὰ Κῦρον τὸν ἀρχαῖον γενομένων βασιλικώτατός τε καὶ ἄρχειν ἀξιώτατος , ὡς παρὰ πάντων ὁμολογεῖται τῶν Κύρου δοκούντων ἐν πείρᾳ γενέσθαι .		In this way, then, Cyrus came to his end, a man who was the most kingly and the most worthy to rule of all the Persians who have been born since Cyrus the Elder, as all agree who are reputed to have known Cyrus intimately.

He likewise summoned the troops which were besieging Miletus, and urged the Milesian exiles to take the field with him, promising them that, if he should successfully accomplish the object for which he was taking the field, he would not stop until he had restored them to their homes.

Therefore, although he keeps sending for me, I decline to go, chiefly, it is true, from a feeling of shame, because I am conscious that I have proved utterly false to him, but, besides that, from fear that he may seize me and inflict punishment upon me for the wrongs he thinks he has suffered at my hands.

Once in particular, when they came upon a narrow, muddy place which was hard for the wagons to get through, Cyrus halted with his train of nobles and dignitaries and ordered Glus and Pigres to take some of the barbarian troops and help to pull the wagons out.	['ἀγαθός']	1	['ἀρίστοις']	['ADV']

But Proxenus–for he chanced to be now coming up, later than the others, with a battalion of hoplites following him–straightway led his troops into the space between the two parties, halted them under arms, and began to beg Clearchus not to proceed with his attack.

At any rate, after Tissaphernes had thus come off with the worst of it, he did not wheel round again, but went on to the camp of the Greeks and there fell in with the King; so it was that, after forming their lines once more, they were proceeding together.

Thereupon various speakers arose, some of their own accord to express the opinions they held, but others at the instigation of Clearchus to make clear the difficulty of either remaining or departing without the consent of Cyrus.

But if you be men and if my undertaking turn out well, I shall make anyone among you who wishes to return home an object of envy to his friends at home upon his return, while I shall cause many of you, I imagine, to choose life with me in preference to life at home.

At this time, when the troops were marshalled under arms, the number of the Greeks was found to be ten thousand four hundred hoplites, and two thousand five hundred peltasts, while the number of the barbarians under Cyrus was one hundred thousand and there were about twenty scythe-bearing chariots.

Clearchus, accordingly, did not lead the army up the hill, but halted at its foot and sent Lycius the Syracusan and another man to the summit, directing them to observe what was beyond the hill and report back to him.

After he had spoken another man arose to point out the foolishness of the speaker who had urged them to ask for vessels, just as if Cyrus were going home again, and to point out also how foolish it was to ask for a guide from this man whose enterprise we are ruining.

Again, Aristippus the Thessalian chanced to be a friend of Cyrus, and since he was hard pressed by his political opponents at home, he came to Cyrus and asked him for three months’ pay for two thousand mercenaries, urging that in this way he should get the better of his opponents.

After this Cyrus marched four stages, twenty parasangs, to the Chalus river, which is a plethrum in width and full of large, tame fish; these fish the Syrians regarded as gods, and they would not allow anyone to harm them, or the doves, either.

Furthermore, one who observed closely could see at a glance that while the King’s empire was strong in its extent of territory and number of inhabitants, it was weak by reason of the greatness of the distances and the scattered condition of its forces, in case one should be swift in making his attack upon it.

It was because of this pass that Cyrus had sent for the fleet, in order that he might disembark hoplites between and beyond the walls and thus overpower the enemy if they should be keeping guard at the Syrian Gates—and that was precisely what Cyrus supposed Abrocomas would do, for he had a large army.

Thereupon they proceeded in great haste to take their places, Clearchus occupying the right end of the Greek wing, close to the Euphrates river, Proxenus next to him, and the others beyond Proxenus, while Menon and his army took the left end of the Greek wing.

And then, as they went on faster and faster, at length with a shout the troops broke into a run of their own accord, in the direction of the camp. As for the barbarians, they were terribly frightened; the Cilician queen took to flight in her carriage, and the people in the market left their wares behind and took to their heels.

2660	120	1.2.21	τῇ δ’ ὑστεραίᾳ ἧκεν ἄγγελος λέγων ὅτι λελοιπὼς εἴη Συέννεσις τὰ ἄκρα , ἐπεὶ ᾔσθετο ὅτι τὸ Μένωνος στράτευμα ἤδη ἐν Κιλικίᾳ ἦν εἴσω τῶν ὀρέων , καὶ ὅτι τριήρεις ἤκουε περιπλεούσας ἀπ’ Ἰωνίας εἰς Κιλικίαν Ταμὼν ἔχοντα τὰς Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ αὐτοῦ Κύρου .		On the following day, however, a messenger came with word that Syennesis had abandoned the heights, because he had learned that Menon’s army was already in Cilicia, on his own side of the mountains, and because, further, he was getting reports that triremes belonging to the Lacedaemonians and to Cyrus himself were sailing around from Ionia to Cilicia under the command of Tamos.

When Cyrus saw that the Greeks were victorious over the division opposite them and were in pursuit, although he was pleased and was already being saluted with homage as King by his attendants, he nevertheless was not induced to join the pursuit, but, keeping in close formation the six hundred horsemen of his troop, he was watching to see what the King would do.

And wherever fodder was exceedingly scarce and he was able to get it for his own use because of the large number of his servants and because of his good planning, he would distribute this fodder among his friends and tell them to give it to the horses that carried their own bodies, that they might not be hungry while carrying his friends.

In general, it was clear that Cyrus was in haste throughout the whole journey and was making no delays, except where he halted to procure provisions or for some other necessary purpose; his thought was that the faster he went, the more unprepared the King would be to fight with him, while, on the other hand, the slower he went, the greater would be the army that was gathering for the King.

They accordingly countermarched and made ready to meet his attack in case he should advance in that direction ; the King, however, did not do so, but returned by the same route he had followed before, when he passed outside of Cyrus’ left wing, and in his return picked up not only those who had deserted to the Greeks during the battle, but also Tissaphernes and his troops.

Again, when he was sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia, Greater Phrygia, and Cappadocia and was also appointed commander of all the troops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of Castolus, he showed, in the first place, that he counted it of the utmost importance, when he concluded a treaty or compact with anyone or made anyone any promise, under no circumstances to prove false to his word.

It was now about full-market time and the stopping-place where Cyrus was intending to halt had been almost reached, when Pategyas, a trusty Persian of Cyrus’ staff, came into sight, riding at full speed, with his horse in a sweat, and at once shouted out to everyone he met, in the barbarian tongue and in Greek, that the King was approaching with a large army, all ready for battle.

Clearchus, however, since he saw the compact body at the enemy’s centre and heard from Cyrus that the King was beyond his left wing (for the King was so superior in numbers that, although occupying the centre of his own line, he was beyond Cyrus’ left wing), was unwilling to draw the right wing away from the river, for fear that he might be turned on both flanks; and he told Cyrus, in reply, that he was taking care to make everything go well.
