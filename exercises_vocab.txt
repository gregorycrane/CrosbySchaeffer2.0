1. Read the entire English sentence, noting how the
words are related.

2, Call to mind Greek words with meanings like those
in English.

3, Consider the changes in form needed to express the
relations suggested by the English.

4. Form the Greek sentence mentally and say it aloud
before starting to write.

5. Write the sentence, with accents and breathings.

(2) Write in Greek :

1. The brothers were small. 

2. They are sending the man to the general. 
8. The general is sending the enemy away from the river.

4. He sends the man out of the river. 
5. They were brothers of the general.

20. Βρεκεκεκὲξ κοὰξ κοάξ. This is the famous refrain of the frog chorus in Aristophanes’ comedy, The Frogs. In unison with this unceasing chant Dionysus rows Charon’s boat across the Styx. It is the basis of Yale’s well-known yell.

A GREEK Boy‘s TABLET

Here we see half of a school tablet used by some Greek lad more than
2000 years ago. At the top the master has written two lines of verse, which
the pupil has tried to reproduce twice in the space below. See if you can
find mistakes in his work.

like the genitive plural of the o-declension.
 
Inflect in all three genders dyads and 8jAes. Compare with para-
digms, § 510, a.

31. Position of Adjectives. (a) When an adjective or
an adjective phrase accompanies a noun with a definite
article, the adjective usually stands between the article
and the noun, as in English:

ὁ δίκικος ἄνθρωπος the just man.
a ty 
Note that (unlike English) even a prepositional phrase
may stand in this position:
οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἄνθρωποι or οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ1 the men in the village.

The adjective may also follow the noun and have the article repeated with it:
ὃ ἄνθρωπος ὃ δίκαιος the Just man.

In the above instances the adjective or phrase is said to
have the attributive position.

(β) When an adjective precedes the article or follows
the article and the noun without the article being repeated, it is said to stand in the predicate position:

δίκαιος ὁ ἄνθρωπος or ὁ ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος the man (is) just. 

32. Dative of Possession. In English we say There is no lid to the box. The Latin says Puero est gladius, the boy has a sword. So in Greek the dative is used to denote
the possessor, while the thing possessed is subject of the
verb to be:

φυλακὴ οὐκ ἦν τῇ κώμῃ 
the village had no garrison,

THe THEATER OF Dionysus

This is probably the earliest extant theater in the world. It is built on the
southern slope of the acropolis at Athens. Here th

35. Word-formation. It is interesting to follow the
changes in meanings of words. Words are living creatures and as such they coristantly acquire new characteristics and new aptitudes as they adjust themselves to new conditions.

Thus σκηνή, tent or booth, was originally used of the tent or
booth into which an actor withdrew to change his costume.
When the theater became more elaborate, σκηνή referred to the
wall that served as support for painted scenery. From this it
was but a step to σκηνή meaning the scene of an action.

grief.

he will pursue the enemy ten stades.

he will pursue the enemy ten days.

They will be treated later.

1 Many Greek adjectives when preceded by the article are used as nouns,
Compare English, the blind, a word to the wise; and the Greek, οἱ πολέμιοι.
2 As in English, Greek questions are sometimes introduced by an interrogative pronoun or adverb, but often the mark of interrogation at the end of a printed sentence is the only clue. This mark of interrogation in Greek is the
same as the English semicolon (;).


@21

(c) Write in Greek :

1. The messenger had (use ἦν) a horse. 
2. The truce was long. 
3. The men in the village are not guarding the tents.
4. The flight was not evident to the general. 
5. The garrison did not have (use ἦσαν) tents.

THE ACROPOLIS

Although many Greek cities had a fortified hill, or acropolis, most people
associate that word with the famous hi!l in the heart of Athens. At first the
home of the early kings, it came to be devoted to the gods and heroes of the
state. Its glorious temples were visible from the agora, as indeed for miles
around in all directions.

40. Word-formation. (a) A very common means of
forming adjectives is by adding to the stem of a noun
the suffix -ιος, -ία, -ιον, which appears frequently in English as -ian. O-stems drop the o before this suffix, α-stems retain the α to form the diphthong αι:

φίλος friend, φίλιος friendly;
but Ἀθῆναι Athens, Ἀθηναῖος Athenian.

(2) From δίκαιον and πολέμιος construct the corresponding nouns; from ἵππος and ἀγορά construct the corresponding adjectives.

@22

ἔργον δ᾽ οὐδὲν ὄνειδος, ἀεργίη δέ τ᾽ ὄνειδος.
Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace.
Hesiod, Works and Days, 311.

42. Formation. The imperfect tense is built on the
present stem showing the variable vowel (ο or ε). Being
a secondary3 tense, it differs from the present in having
(1) augment, (2) secondary endings. It is found only
in the indicative.

43. Augment. All secondary tenses of the indicative
may be recognized by what is called augment. This is of
two kinds:

1. Syllabic. Verbs with an initial consonant prefix ἐ
by way of augment; an initial ῥ is doubled after ἐ.

@24

2. Temporal.

Verbs with an initial vowel or diphthong lengthen the initial vowel.


α - η
ε - η
ο - ω
ι - ῑ
υ - ῡ
αι  - ῃ
αυ  - ηυ
οι  - ῳ

Inflect the imperfect indicative active of πέμπω and ἀθροίζω.

44. Dative of Manner.

The dative may denote manner :?

φεύγουσι σιγῇ they flee in silence.

45. Balanced Structure.
μέν ... δέ are used with
two words or phrases or
clauses that are compared
or contrasted: 

ὁ (ἢ, τὸ) μέν . . ὁ (ἡ, τὸ) δέ the one . . . the other; 

οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) μέν. .. οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) δέ some . . . others; 
ὁ δέ, ἡ δέ, κ.τ.λ. but (and) he, she, etc., 
indicating change of subject. μέν is rarely to be translated but is a valuable warning that a comparison or contrast is coming. It is one of the many little words, often untranslatable, that make Greek so effective for expressing important shades of meaning.

An Ionic CoLtumn

The delicate workmanship of the
Erechtheum, to which this column
belongs, awakens universal admiration.

1 Certain verbs beginning with ε chauge ε to ει when augmented : ἔχω,

εἶχον.

2 This is our fifth use of the dative. What were the other four?
3. κ.τ.λ. = καὶ τὰ λοιπά and the rest. Compare etc. = et cetera.

48. Greek as a World Language.



(a) The international language of the first century of our era was Greek. To carry its message to the world, therefore, the New Testament was written in Greek. The following passage is from St. Luke,
6. 45:


ὁ μὲν ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐκ
τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ (treasure) τῆς καρδίας (compare
CARDIAC) προφέρει (brings
forth) τὸ ἀγαθόν,1 ὁ δὲ πονη- 
ρὸς 1 (evil) ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ 1 τὸ
πονηρον.1

(b) Word-formation. The Christian religion not only was transmitted through Greek. Its theology was shaped by Greek philosophy and its language and thought by Greek words.

Hundreds of ecclesiastical terms now in use came from Greek : Christ, Bible, Episcopalian, anthem, hierarchy, cathedral, liturgy, Pentatench, atheist, apostate, martyr, menphiyte, hypocrite, laity, CANON.
and the like,

How many similar derivatives can you supply from the

Greek words that you have already had ?

Try these:

λόγος (combine with φίλος, and δέκα), ἀπό, ἐξ (combine with ὁδός road), παρά, ἄγγελος, διά.

LESSON IX 

FUTURE INDICATIVE AND INFINITIVE ACTIVE OF 0-VERBS

καλὸν ἡσυχία.
Leisure is a fine thing.
Periander

49. The Future Tense. This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding o to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form y (πσ) ;

2, A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form & (κσ);

3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:

πέμπω, πέμψω; ἄγω, ἄξω; ἀθροίζω (ἀθροιδ-), ἀθροίσω.

In most instances, the stem is readily recognized in the
present tense, but verbs with stems in ζ are palatals and most verbs with stems in fare dentals. In case of doubt, consult the general vocabulary at the back of the book.

Future Indicative of παύω I stop

In like manner inflect Ata, ypadw, dpyw, re(Ow.

59. Indirect Discourse. (a) Verbs whose meaning implies mental action (saying, thinking, or the like) are used to introduce an indirect quotation : the general sends (sent)

@27

may be stated indirectly 
I believe the general to be sending
(to have sent), or 
I believe that the general is sending (sent).

(b) In Latin the main verb in the quoted statement
is always infinitive. The same construction is frequently found in Greek.1

(c) In Latin, the subject of the infinitive in
indirect discourse is always accusative. The
same is true for Greek,
unless the infinitive has
the same subject as the
introductory verb, in
which case the subject
of the infinitive is omitted and any word in 
agreement with that unxpressed subject is nominative:

νομίζω τὸν στρατηγὸν διώξειν
I think the general will pursue ;

νομίζω διώξειν
I think I shall pursue.

(d) The tense of the
infinitive in the quoted statement, regardless of the tense of the introductory verb, is the same as that used in the original statement:

οἱ πολέμιοι διώκουσι
the enemy are pursuing ;

νομίζει τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν
he thinks the enemy are pursuing;

ἐνόμιζε τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν
he thought that the enemy were pursuing.

1 But in Greek other constructions appear. depending on the introductory verb employed.

THE PROPYLAEA

The gateway to the Acropolis.

2. With a shout we were seizing the provisions. 
3. The man used to write to his! brother. 
4. The works were ancient, but beautiful. 
5. They were brave in speech.

 

  

53. Word-formation. Many verbs with ε in the stem
have cognate nouns or adjectives with ο instead of ε:
λείπω leave, λοιπὸς left;
λέγω speak, λόγος word or speech ;
πέμπω send (escort), πομπή procession ;
σπένδω pour a libation, σπονδή Libation.

Compare Latin tego I cover, toga cloak; English £ sing, song.

 

 

ὁδὸς ἀρχαία
This fine roadway, bordered with elevated sidewalks, led from the agora
at Corinth to the harbor. The ancient Greeks did most of their travel by sea
and so had few good roads,

LESSON X

FIRST AND SECOND AORIST INDICATIVE AND INFINITIVE
ACTIVE OF Ω-VERES

ὅ τι καλὸν φίλον ἀεί.— A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Literally: Whatever is beautiful is ever dear.
Euripides, Bacchae, 881. 

54. The Aorist. Aorist is the name of a tense of the
Greek verb. The name is not used in the inflection of
Latin or English verbs, but many of its functions are
entirely familiar.
 
The aorist indicative in Greek expresses a single act (that
is, not continued or repeated) in past time. It gives, as
it were, a snapshot of past action, while the imperfect gives 
a motion picture: 

ἔπαυον I was stopping; ἔπαυσα I stopped.

55. Formation of the Aorist. (a) The aorist, in common with other secondary tenses, in the indicative has
augment and secondary endings (§§ 42, 43).

@31
(b) The distinguishing feature of the first aorist is the
suffix σα (σε in the third singular), which obeys the same
phonetic laws as the σ of the future (§ 49).

(c) The first aorist infinitive active is always accented on the penult:1 ἀθροῖσαι, ἁρπάσαι.

(d) Some verbs lack a first aorist. Such verbs often have a second aorist, a distinguishing feature of which is a
weakening of the vowel element of thestem, The second aorist indicative is inflected like the imperfect, and the corresponding infinitive has an ending like that of the present infinitive, but it is accented irregularly on the ultima: 
ἄγω, ἤγαγον, ἀγαγεῖν;
λείπω, ἔλιπον, λιπεῖν;
φεύγω, ἔφυγον, φυγεῖν.
(e) The third form in the principal parts of a normal
verb shows by the presence of -σα (-α)2 or -ον whether the
aorist is first or second.

Inflect λύω and φεύγω in the aorist indicative and infinitive.

56. There is usually no difference of meaning between
first and second aorist, the terms signifying merely differ-
ence in formation:

ἔπαυσοα (first aorist) I stopped ; ἔλιπον (second aorist) I left.

57. Tenses of the Infinitive. The infinitive, except in

indirect discourse, has no time value. The present infinitive denotes continuance or repetition (a motion picture),
while the aorist infinitive denotes a single occurrence (a snap-shot): 

ἐθέλει φεύγειν he wishes to keep on fleeing ;
ἐθέλει φυγεῖν he wishes to flee.



1 See § V, f.
2 The type of verbs that have only -α and not -σα in the first aorist will be presented later.

LESSON XII

READING 

ὦ ταὶ λιπαραὶ καὶ ἰοστέφανοι καὶ ἀοίδιμοι,
Ἑλλάδος ἔρεισμα, κλειναὶ Ἀθᾶναι.

City of light, with your violet crown, beloved of the poets,
You are the bulwark of Greece; Athens, your fame is for ever.

1 Pindar, fragment. Literally: 
O renowned Athens, brilliant, violet-crowned, and famed in song, stay of Greece.

62. The Value of Transiation. "There is no better wav
for the student to train himself in the choice of the very
word that will fit his thought than by translation from
Latin and Greek. Thus he develops habits of analysis,
habits of discriminating choice of words, habits of accurate
apprehension of the meaning which another has sought to
convey by written words, which lead to power of expression
and to power of clear thinking. Such habits are worth
more to the lawyer than all the information which a modern
school may hope to impart.” <note>Roscoe Pound, Dean of the Law School, Harvard University, as reported
in Value of the Classics, page 49.</note>

63. The Process of Translation. From the very beginning, cultivate right habits, The time thus saved will in
the end repay you for any time that may seem to be lost
at the start.

1. Read aloud and distinctly each Greek sentence as Greek,
without conscious effort at translation.

2. Note familiar words; in unfamiliar words look for familiar
roots or suggestions as to meaning contained in the context,






1. Read aloud and distinctly each Greek sentence as Greek,
without conscious effort at translation.

2. Note familiar words; in unfamiliar words look for familiar
roots or suggestions as to meaning contained in the context.

3. Note carefully word groups and relations of words as indicated by inflectional changes.

4. Do not jump about in the sentence, but try to grasp the
thoughts as they follow in logical sequence, observing that
emphatic words are likely to occur at the beginning or end of
clauses or sentences, 

5. If the meaning of any words is still unknown, consult the
vocabulary.

This is an artificial knoll, about forty feet high, erected over the bodies of
the Athenians slain at Marathon. No simpler memorial could be imagined
for the most heroic exploit in Athenian history.

66. PRONUNCIATION OF ANGLICIZED GREEK PROPER NAMES

(a) Every educated person should know how to pronounce correctly the many Greek proper names that have
passed into English literature and English speech. Especially is this to be expected of every person who has been
privileged to study Greek.

(4) Here are a few simple rules which will help:

1. Because most Greek proper names have come into English via Latin, custom demands first that the Greek letters shali


@39

be replaced by their Latin equivalents.



These can be learned from

§§ I and II, but note especially that 
αι passes into  or e, 
ει into î or ê, 
οι into oe or ê 
(when final, οι becomes î), 
ου into û, 
υ into y (except in diphthongs), 
ος into us:

Θησεῖον Theseum, 
Φοῖβος Phoebus,
Φίλιπποι Philippi, 
Ἐπίκουρος Epicurus,

Αἴσχυλος Aischylus, 
Αἰθιοπία Ethiopia, 
Ἀριστείδης Aristides,
Κύκλωψ Cyclops,

Φοῖνιξ Phoenician

2. Use the ordinary English sounds for the letters, remembering that c (for k) and g are “soft” before e or i sounds.

3. Names that have become  very common in English are likely to have lost or changed their inflectional endings:

Ἀθῆναι Athens,  
Συράκουσαι Syracuse, 
Ὅμηρος Homer, 
Πλάτων Plato, 
Ἀλέξανδρος Alexander.

Bronze Boy FROM MARATHON

This head belongs to a beautiful statue found in almost perfect condition by a fisherman in the Bay of Marathon in 1925.

4. The anglicized form is to
be accented according to the
Latin rules: two-syllabled
words accent the penult; poly-syllables accent the penult, if
long, otherwise the antepenult:
A'thens, Ody'sseus, Pene'lope.1

(c) Transliterate into English and pronounce :

Κυθέρεια 
Ἀγαμέμνων 
Βορέᾱς 
Κῦρος
Ἡρόδοτος 
Ἀφροδίτη <note>Final η, when transliterated inta é, is regularly sounded.</note>
Θουκυδίδης 
Ἀπόλλων
Ζεύς 
Χάρων 
Σωκράτης 
Λυκοῦργος

(a) Words other than proper names have suffered still greater changes as to ending:

φιλοσοφίᾳ philosophy

ἄγγελος angel, 
ὠκεανός ocean,


σπασμός spasm,



φιλόσοφος philosopher,

LESSON XIII

PRONOUNS

ἕτερος γὰρ αὐτὸς ὁ φίλος ἐστί.
A friend is another self.
Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, IX. 9,10, 1170 B

67. The relative pronoun, ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, who, which, presents
nothing new in inflection, It is like ἀγαθός everywhere
except in the neuter nominative and accusative singular,
where it has the same endings as the article.

6s who, which

MOF N M. F. N.
¥ » ” - . ”
og n 3 ot ae a
co . * . °
ov nS ov ov ov av
*
é q & ois als ots
e é 5 ; y y
ov ow ots as a

68. αὐτός self, and ἄλλος other, are inflected similarly
except that ἄλλος has the accent on the penult. Inflect
them and compare with paradigms (§§ 519 and 520).

69. A relative pronoun, as in English and in Latin,
agrees with its antecedent in gender, number, and person,
but its case depends on the construction in its own clause:

ὁ ἄγγελος ὃν ἔπεμψας ἐθέλει φυγεῖν
the messenger whom you sent wishes to flee.

70. Uses of atrés. Following the article, it means
same ; modifying a noun or pronoun, but not following
the article, it means se(f; standing alone, except in the
nominative, it is a personal pronoun of the third person:

ἡ αὐτὴ κώμῃ the same village,
Κῦρος αὐτός Cyrus himself,
αὐτῷ ἔγραψα I wrote to him,
ἡ κώμη αὐτή the village itself ;
αὐτὸς ἔφυγεν he himself fled ;
αὐτοὺς ἀθροίζει he collects them.

AN ANCIENT TIMEPIECE
This Horologium, or Tower of the Winds, stood in the Agora and served
as both weather bureau and town clock. It was surmounted by a weather-
vane. Sundials adorned the exterior, and within was a water clock. The
figures beneath the cornice represent the eight winds.

LESSON XIV

DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS
σπεῦδε βραδέως. — 
Make haste slowly.
Suetonius, Augustus, 25. A favorite expression of Augustus.

74, The principal demonstrative pronouns are οὗτος this
(Latin hic), ὅδε this, and ἐκεῖνος that (Latin ille).

οὗτος this


Note that οὗτος has the same endings as αὐτός (§ 68), that it has
initial τ- only where the article 6, 7, 76 has τ-, and that it has ου in
the penult only when anοo-sound occurs in the ultima, having αυ in
the other forms.

Contrast οὗτος and αὐτός as to breathing, accent, and stem.

Note that the forms of ὅδε are the forms of the article with -δέ
added.


75. ἐκεῖνος has the same endings and accents as obtos,
Inflect it, and compare with paradigm (§ 523).

44 AN INTRODUCTION TO GREEK

76. Uses of the Demonstratives. (a) οὗτος and ὅδε both
mean this, this book, ete.; but οὗτος usually refers to something already mentioned, and ὅδε to something yet to
follow:

ταῦτα ἔγραψε 
this (just mentioned) is what he wrote ;
ἔγραψε τάδε 
he wrote as follows.

(b) ἐκεῖνος refers to something more remote than do
οὗτος and ὅδε and is translated that.
(c) All three may be used as emphatic personal pronouns,
he, she, it, they.
(d) When used as demonstrative adjectives all three
have the predicate position (§ 31, 2):
αὕτη ἡ κώμη this village ;
ἐκείνη ἡ κώμη that village.

77. Dative of Means. The dative indicates the means

whereby an act is done: <note>The dative has three distinct divisions as to use, corresponding to English phrases with to or for, with, and in.</note>
τὸν ποταμὸν διαβαίνει πλοίῳ  
he crosses the river in (by means of) a boat.

78. VOCABULARY
ἀ-διά-βατος:2 uncrossable. aotov, -ov, 76: boat.

σύν, prep. with D.: with. SYNOD.
ὅδε, ἤδε, τόδε: this (as follows).

80. Dean Inge, of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, writes:
“The Christian Church was the last great creative achieve-
ment of classical culture.”<note>Legacy of Greece, page 30.
</note> The λόγος of St. John’s
Gospel is one of many evidences of this.

ἐν ἀρχῇ ἣν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἣν πρὸς (in the presence of) ὃ τὸν θεόν
(compare THEOLOGY), καὶ θεὸς ἣν ὁ λόγος. οὗτος ἣν ἐν
ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν.

St. John, I. 1-2.

LESSON XV

FEMININE NOUNS OF THE A-DECLENSION. PERSONAL
PRONOUNS

θάλαττα, θάλαττα. 

The sea, the sea!
Xenophon, Andbusis, IV. 7, 24. 2 

81. Feminines in -ᾰ. Most nouns of the adeclension
have -ᾱ or -η in the nominative and carry the same throughout the singular. A few nouns have -ᾰ in the nominative.
These have ᾱ in the genitive and dative singular, if the
preceding letter is ι or ρ; otherwise they have η.


Note that in the singular, nominative and accusative agree as to
final vowel, quantity of final vowel, and accent; and that the genitive
and dative show the same agreement,

In like manner inflect θάλαττα and βασίλεια.

82. The Personal Pronouns are ἐγώ, σύ you (thou), for
the first and second persons. For the third person, αὐτός
is used in all cases except the nominative.

2 For accent, see § V, e, f, g.

3 The unaccented forms are enclitic (§ V,j). When used, they show that
no emphasis is intended. The accented forms are emphatic or are used with
prepositions. The nominative is not used except when emphasis is desired.

@47

83. Particular Conditions. (a) εἰ with a present or past
tense of the indicative in the protasis1 and the same tense
of the indicative or its equivalent in the apodosis1 states a
particular condition without implying anything as to its
fulfillment or non-fulfillment. This is called a particular
condition in present or past time:

εἰ τὴν γέφυραν φυλάττει, τὰς σπονδὰς λύει 
if he is guarding the bridge, he is breaking the treaty ;

εἰ ... ἐφύλαξε, ... ἔλυσε 
if he guarded ..., he broke... .

(b)) The regular negative of the protasis is μή, of the
apodosis οὐ.
  
84. VOCABULARY
ἅμαξα: cart, wagon. 

βασίλεια: queen. 
γέφῡρα: bridge. 
ἐγώ: J. EGOTIST. 
ὅπλον: implement, tool ;
εἰ, proclit. conj.: if. frequently pl, arms (in war). PANOPLY.
θάλαττα: sea. 
κακός: bad, cowardly. CACOPHONY.
οὖν, post-pos. conj.: therefore, then,  accordingly.

μή, neg.ady.:not, Found instead of οὐ with most uses of the infinitive and in conditional clauses.

σύ: thou, you.

85. EXERCISES

(a) Translate :

1. ἡμῖν μὲν ἦσαν ἅμαξαι, ὑμῖν δ᾽ οὔ.
2. οἱ σὺν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τὴν γέφυραν δι-ἔβαινον. 
3. ἐγὼ δ᾽ οὖν ἐνόμιζον σὲ τὴν οἰκίαν φυλάττειν. 
4. ἐκείνη γὰρ οὐχ ὑπ-ώπτευσεν ὑμᾶς ἀλλήλοις ἐπι- βουλεύσειν. 
5. τὰ αὐτὰ ὅπλα ἣν ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, 
6. εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ τὴν θάλατταν ἄγεις τὴν φυλακήν, οὐ λύεις τὰς σπονδάς.

1 The terms “protasis” and "apodosis" denote respectively the “if clause” and the "conclusion ” of conditional sentences.
2 Proclitic of takes an accent at the end of a sentence, because no word follows with which it may be pronounced.

7. οἱ μὲν κακοὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἁμαξῶν ἔφυγον, ἡ δὲ βασίλεια οὐκ ἔλιπε τὴν γέφύραν. 
8. εἰ ὁ ποταμὸς ἣν δια-βατός, ἤθελον αὐτὸν δια-βαίνειν.

LESSON XVI

MASCULINE NOUNS OF THE A-DECLENSION. REFLEXIVE
PRONOUNS

ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σαυτόν.
Thou shalt love thy neighbor us thyself
St. Matthew, XIX. 19.

87. Masculine Nouns of the α-declension. Most nouns
of the α-declension are feminine. Masculines may be
recognized not merely as referring to males but also as showing -ης or -ας instead of -η or -α in the nominative singular.
Their genitive singular ends in -ου. Otherwise the inflection parallels that of the feminines.

Note the two indications of masculine gender in -ς of the nomina-

tive singular and -ου of the genitive singular, both of which occur in

the ο-declension.

In like manner inflect ὁπλίτης.

88. Reflexive Pronouns are formed from the stems of the
personal pronouns and the proper case forms of αὐτός. In
the plural of the first and second persons both parts of the
word are fully inflected. The pronoun of the third person,
however, has the compounded form in the plural.

For obvious reasons the reflexive pronouns of the first and second persons have no neuter.

@50 
89. Reflexive Pronouns appear in the predicate and refer
to the subject of the sentence or clause in which they stand.
As such they are direct refleaives. Sometimes they appear
in a dependent clause and refer to the subject of the main
clause. They then are indirect reflexives:

ἧκον ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ σκηνὴν
I went to my own tent;

ἔπεισαν ἐμὲ ἥκειν ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν σκηνήν
they persuaded me to go to their (own) tent.

90. VOCABULARY

ἑ-αυτοῦ : of himself, herself;
itself.

ἐμ-αυτοῦ: of myself.

ἐξελαύνω,2 ἐξήλασα: drive out, march forth, march on.

μένω:2 remain, wait for.

Ξενίας: Xenias, an Arcadian general serving under Cyrus, the younger.

ὁπλίτης: hoplite, a heavy-armed soldier, Cf. 





πολίτης: citizen, POLITICS,

σατράπης: satrap, a Persian viceroy.

σεαυτοῦ: Of yourself.

σταθμός: haiting-place, day’s march,

στρατιώτης: soldier. Cf. στρατιά, στρατηγός.

1 Contracted forms gavrod and abroé are often used in place of ceavrod and ἑαυτοῦ.

2 The future of this verb is irregular.

2. καὶ τὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ διπλάσια (doubles) ἴσα ἀλλήλοις ἐστίν.

3. καὶ τὰ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἡμίση (halves, compare hemisphere) ἴσα ἀλλήλοις ἐστίν.

LESSON XVII

PRESENT AND {MPERFECT INDICATIVE AND PRESENT
INFINITIVE OF εἰμί. ENCLITICS

ἄγροικός εἶμι· τὴν σκάφην σκάφην λέγω.
Lam from the country; I call a spade a spade.
Comic Attic fragment. 
Literally : I am a countryman; I call the tub a tub.

93. The verb eipi to de is irregular, as are the corresponding verbs in English and Latin.

94. All forms of the present indicative of εἰμί except
εἶ are enclitic. ἔστι when thus accented means exists or is
possible, except that it is regularly so accented after ἀλλά,
καί, μή, οὐκ, τοῦτο, ὡς and εἰ (if), whether it has this spe-
cial meaning or not.

(b) If the preceding word has an acute on the antepenult or a circumflex on the penult, it receives an additional acute on the ultima and the enclitic has no accent :

ἄνθρωποί εἰσιν they are men;
στρατιῶταί εἰσιν they are soldiers.

@53

(c) If the preceding word has an acute on the penult,
an enclitic of one syllable has no accent but an enclitic of
two syllables is accented on the final syllable:

ὁπλίτης τις a certain hoplite ;
ὁπλίτης ἐστίν he is a hoplite.

96. Accent of Augmented Verbs. The accent cannot
precede the augment. Therefore compound verbs are ac-
cented after the prefix :

ἐξάγω, ἐξῆγον ; ἄπ-ειμι, ἀπ-ῆν.

97. Contrary to Fact Conditions. εἰ with a past tense
of the indicative in the protasis and a past tense of the indicative with ἄν in the apodosis implies that the condition
is not or was not fulfilled. This is called a contrary to
fact condition, The imperfect tense indicates present time ;
the aorist indicates past time :

εἰ τὴν γέφυραν ἐφύλαττε, τας σπονδὰς ἂν ἔλυεν 
if he were guarding the bridge, he would be breaking the treaty ;

εἰ... ἐφύλαξε, . .. ἂν ἔλῡσεν 
if he had guarded ..., he would have broken... .



Note carefully that the presence of ἄν in the apodosis distinguishes
a contrary to fact from a past particular condition (§ 85).

98. VOCABULARY

ἄν, post-pos. particle belonging to certain types of conditional clauses but lacking an exact English eqnivalent.

ἄπ-ειμι: be away, be absent.

εἰμί enclit.: be.

ἔξ-ἐστι(ν),2 impersonal ; it is possible.

οὔπω, neg. adv. : not yet.

πάρ-ειμι: be present.

τόπος: place. TOPOGRAPUY.

τότε, adv.: then, at that time.

φᾱσί(ν),2 enclit.; they say.

φησί(ν),2 enclit.: he or she says, PROPHET.

LESSON XVIIL
CONSONANT DECLENSION (K-STEMS)

δέσποινα γὰρ γέροντι νυμφίῳ γυνή.
An old man’s bride, an old man’s boss.
Euripides, fragment. 
Literally: For to an aged bridegroom a wife is
mistress

101. The Consonant Declension includes nouns whose
stems end in a consonant.

The stem appears when the ending -ος is dropped from
the genitive singular. To this stem the endings for the
other cases are added.

The ending for the nominative singular should be learned
from the vocabulary. Sometimes it ends in -s. The dative
plural ends in -σι. The σ in each of these instances unites
with κ, γ, or χ to form ξ.

102. Monosyllables of the consonant declension are
accented on the ultima in the genitive and dative of all
numbers, the circumflex occurring on long vowels or diph-
thongs, otherwise the acute.

Inflect @paé. Compare with paradigm (§ 509, a).

106. THE PHALANX

By means of the phalanx, invented and developed by
Greeks, Alexander the Great imposed his will upon most
of the civilized world. In the hands of the Romans, who
were quick to grasp its possibilities, it grew into the famous
legion.


“The average depth of the phalanx was eight men,
although it occasionally reached sixteen, even before the
time of the Macedonians. Epaminondas made his left
wing about fifty ranks deep. The spear might be twenty-one feet long, or even twenty-four in Hellenistic times.
Five or six rows of spear points would project beyond the
front rank making an impenetrable barrier. The spears
of the rear ranks rested upon the shoulders of men in front
with their points directed upward. The formation looked
like a huge porcupine with the quills pointing in one
direction. The Roman consul, Lucius Aemilius, a seasoned
veteran, confessed to friends at Rome that he had never
seen anything more terrible and alarming than the Macedonian phalanx of Perseus.”

E.S. McCartney, Warfare by Land and Sea, pages 25-27.

LESSON XXI

PARTICIPLES

ἐλπὶς ἐν ἀνθρώποις μούνη θεὸς ἐσθλὴ ἔνεστιν.
Hope is man’s one good deity.
Theognis, 1135.

113. Present Participle. The masculine of the present
participle is inflected like ἄρχων ($107). The neuter has
the same endings except in the nominative and accusative
singular, where it uses the mere stem with τ dropped (beause τ cannot end a Greek word), and in the same cases
in the plural, where it adds -α to the stem. The feminine
is inflected like dyaka (§ 81).

114. The present and future active participles of παύω
are inflected like dy with the accent on παυ- or παυσ-,
wherever the rules of accent permit. The second aorist
active participle is also inflected like &» and has the same
accents.

Write out entire the inflection of παύων, παύσων, λιπών.
Compare with paradigms (§ 514, a).

@65

115. First Aorist Actrve Particirte or Tato J stop

ravoas navodoa. matey
mavoavTos Tavaaoys TavcavTos
qaioayTt ravoaon maveavTt
qatoavTa Tavoacay matoay
ravcayres ravaarat mavoayra. 
TavodyTwy Tavoaciy mavadvTov
ratcaat(v) ravoicats raioaar(y)
TavgavTas Tavoacas matoavTa

Note that the stem here used is that of the first aorist active. The
endings are the same as those of the present participle, except in the
nominative singular, where -ς has been added to the stem, causing wr
to drop out and lengthening α. In like manner inflect ceAaioas.

116. Uses of Participles. (a) A participle, when used in
the attributive position ($ 31, a), has the force of an attributive adjective. his is called the attributive participle :

ὁ διαρπάζων στρατιώτης the plundering soldier, 

The attributive participle often has its noun implied
and may be translated by a noun or a relative clause. This
is the regular equivalent of the English he who, those who:

οἱ φεύγοντες the fugitives or those who are fleeing.

(4) A participle, when used without an article and in
agreement with a noun or pronoun expressed or implied,
is called the circumstantial participle. It may denote time,
manner, means, cause, condition, concession, or any attendant
circumstances of an action.

φεύγοντες δια-βαίνομεν τὸν ποταμόν in flight we cross the river ;
ἔχων χρήματα εἶχες ἂν φίλους if you had money, you would have friends.

117. Tenses of the Participle usually indicate time as
related to that of the main verb:

φεύγων δια-βαίνει while fleeing he crosses ;
φυγὼν δια-βαίνει having fled he crosses.

LESSON XXII

πᾶς. READING
πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἄνθρωπος. — 
Man is the measure of all things
Protagoras

121. Inflection of πᾶς. πᾶς has the same endings as
παύσᾱς. The genitive and dative plural of the masculine
and neuter violate the rule for accent of monosyllables of
the consonant declension (§ 102). The accent of the
feminine is regular.



122. Uses of πᾶς. (a) πᾶς, when modifying a noun,
usually has the predicate qgosition (§ 31, 6) and means
all: 
 
πᾶσαι αἱ ὅδοί all the roads ;
πᾶσα ἡ ὁδός all the road.

(b) πᾶς in the attributive position (§ 31, a) means
the whole (the entire number or amount) :

ἡ πᾶσα ὁδός the whole road, the entire road.

(c) was without an article means all (conceivable) or
every:
πᾶσαι ὁδοί all roads ;
πᾶσα ὁδός every road.

φόβος: fear. HYDROPHOBIA. 

The Great God Pan

This uncouth deity of mountain and woodland was believed to have inspired the Persians with "panic" at Marathon and Salamis.

125. Precision of Thought. “The practice of translation, by making us deliberate in the choice of the best
equivalent of a foreign word in our own language, has
likewise the advantage of continually schooling us in one
of the main elements of a good style, — precision ; and
precision of thought is not only exemplified by precision
of language, but is largely dependent on the habit of it.”
James Russell Lowell, Address on Books and Libraries

126. THE REVIEW OF AN ARMY

ἐνταῦθα οὖν θεωρία (review) ἣν τῆς ἹΚύρου στρατιᾶς.1
καὶ πρῶτον μὲν παρ-ήλαυνον οἱ βάρβαροι. εἶτα δὲ τοὺς
Ἕλληνας (compare Ἑλλάς) παρήλαυνον ὁ Κῦρος ἐφ᾽
ἅρματος καὶ ἡ Κίλισσα ἐφ᾽ ἁρμαμάξης (carriage). εἶχον
δὲ πάντες ὅπλα καλά, παριελάσας δὲ τούτους κήρῡκα
ἔπεμψε παρὰ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν ᾿Ελλήνων, ὃς ἐκέλευσεν
αὐτοὺς ἐπι-χωρῆσαι (advance, trans.) πᾶσαν τὴν φάλαγγα.
ἐκ δὲ τούτον οἱ στρατιῶται ἐλαύνοντες σὺν κραυγῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ
αὐτομάτου (compare AUTOMATIC) ἔσπευσαν ἐπὶ τὴς σκηνάς,
τοῖς δὲ βαρβάροις ἦν φόβος, ὥστε ἔφυγον καὶ ἡ Κίλισσα ἐπὶ
τῆς ἁρμαμάξης καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἀγορᾶς τὰ χρήματα κατα-λιπόντες.3 οὕτως οὖν οἱ Ἑλληνες σὺν γέλωτι (laughter) ἐπὶ τὰς σκηνὰς ἧκον.

Adapted from Xenophon, Anabasis, I, 2. 16-18.

 

1 Objective genitive, being the object of the action involved in θεωρία.

2 ἐπί. A word that suffers elision ronghens its mute before a rough breathing.

CONTRACT VERBS IN -έω 
φιλεῖ δὲ τῷ κάμνοντι συσπεύδειν θεός. 
God helps him who helps himself
Aeschylus, fragment. Literally: God loves to assist zealously the man
who works.

127. Contract Verbs. (a) Two successive vowels are
regularly contracted into one long vowel or diphthong :

ε+ω=ω; 
ε+ο ου =—0v; 
ε+ε= ει.

ε is always absorbed by a long vowel or diphthong.

(b) If the first of the contracting syllables is accented,
the resultant syllable receives a circumflex ;

φιλέω, φιλῶ.
 
In other tenses than the present (and imperfect) the
final ε of the stem is regularly lengthened to η:

φιλέω, φιλήσω, ἐφίλησα.

@72

128. Genitive Absolute. A noun or pronoun in the
genitive case with a circumstantial participle in agreement may stand grammatically independent of the rest of
the sentence. This is called the genitive absolute and corresponds to the ablative absolute in Latin and the nominative independent (absolute) in English.

Like any other use of the circumstantial participle, the
genitive absolute may express time, cause, and the like.
It is usually best translated as a clause : 

Κύρου κελεύσαντος ταῦτα ἐποίησαν when Cyrus ordered, they did
this ;

τούτων πράγματα παρ-εχόντων σπεύσομεν if they cause trouble, we
shall hasten ;

τῶν φυλάκων διωκόντων ἔφυγεν with the guards pursuing, he fled.

129. VOCABULARY

ἀ-δικέω, ἀδικήσω, ἠδίκησα: injure,
wrong.

αἰτέω, αἰτήσω, ἤτησα: ask for,

THe ERECHTHEUM
On the spot where Athena contended with Poseidon for the guardianship
of Athens, stands the most elegant of all Greek temples. Near one end
grew the sacred olive of the goddess. Within the shrine was her ancient
wooden image. Beneath the north porch are still shown the marks of
Poseidon's trident. (See the pictures on page 334 and facing page 180.)


132. Word-formation. Verbs formed by adding -έω to
noun (or adjective) stems denote action of a nature similar to that expressed by the noun (or adjective). They 
usually denote a condition or an activity:

φίλος friend, φιλέω be a friend, love ;
πόλεμος war, πολεμέω make war;
ἄδικος unjust, ἀδικέω he unjust, do wrong.

This type of verb is to be found chiefly in connection
with words of the ο-declension.

A DETAIL FROM THE ERECHTHEUM

This honeysuckle pattern, justly famous for its exquisite workmanship, is an
ever-recurring theme in the decoration of the temple.

LESSON XXIV

PRESENT AND IMPERFECT INDICATIVE, PRESENT
INFINITIVE, AND PARTICIPLE OF παύω IN
MIDDLE AND PASSIVE VOICE

ἀνάγκᾳ δ᾽ οὐδὲ θεοὶ μάχονται. — 
Not even gods fight against necessity
Simonides.

133. Passive Voice. Like English and Latin, Greek
has a passive voice, which shows the subject as acted
upon: 

παύομαι. I am being stopped.

134. Middle Voice. Greek also has a middle voice,
which shows that the subject so acts as somehow to affect
himself.

(a) The subject may act on himself:

παύομαι I am stopping myself, I am stopping (intransitive).

(6) The subject may act on or with something that be-
longs to him, ov in such a way as to benefit, injure, or other-
wise affect himself or his interests +

παρέχομαι I supply for myself;
λύομαι τοὺς ἵππους I loose my (own) horses. <note>GRC: If memory serves, there is a nice alternation of luw/luomai with Circe or Calypso and Od</note>

135. Present Indicative Middle and Passive of παύω

136. Imperfect Indicative Middle and Passive of παύω

@76

137. There is no difference in appearance between the
middle and the passive in the present and imperfect. As
in the active voice, the vowel ο appears before μ or ν of
the ending, while ε appears before other endings. The ε
of the second person singular drops out between two
vowels, which are then contracted.

The present and imperfect middle and passive have the
same stem as the present active.

138. Deponent Verbs. Some verbs have forms only in
the middle or passive voice but with active meanings.
They are called deponents :

ἕπομαι I follow.

Inflect the present and imperfect indicative, and give
the present infinitive and participle of wopevopac,

139. Genitive of Agent. iad and the genitive when
modifying a passive verb indicate the ayent or doer of an
action (compare with the Latin a or ab and the ablative): 1

ἀθροίζεται ὑπὸ αὐτοῦ it ts being gathered by him.

140. VOCABULARY
ἄχθομαι: be burdened, vexed. 
μετα-πέμπομαι: send after, sum-
βούλομαι: wish, desire. mon.
ἕπομαι: follow, with D. 
πορεία: journey.
ἔρχομαι, ἦλθον (aor.): come, go. 
πορεύομαι: journey, march,

LESSON XXV

MIDDLE AND PASSIVE OF VERBS IN -éw

He who rules must first obey.
Solon, as quoted by Diogenes Laertius, 1.60. 
Literally: Rule after having first learned to be ruled.

143. Contract Verbs. The principles already learned
(§ 127) as to the contraction and accent of φιλέω in the
present and imperfect active apply to its inflection in the
middle and passive.

Write out the inflection of the present and imperfect indicative middle and passive of φιλέω. Give the present.
infinitive and participle middle and passive. Compare
with paradigms (§ 534). 

144. Temporal Clauses. (a) ἐπεί  and ἐπειδή followed

ἐπεὶ ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν κώμην, αὐτὴν δι-ήρπασαν 
when they came to the village, they pillaged it.

(b)  ἐπεί and ἐπειδή followed by any tense of the indicative may mean because or since:

ἐπεὶ δοκεῖ, ταῦτα ποιήσω since it seems best, I shall do this.

(c) πρίν accompanied by an imperfect or aorist indicative is usually translated until. It is so used only when
the main clause contains a negative :

οὐ ταῦτα ἐποίησα πρὶν ἦλθεν
I did not do this until he came.

@80

(d) πρίν accompanied by an infinitive can only mean
before, in which case there will be no negative in the main clause :

FUTURE AND AORIST MIDDLE
 
χαλεπὸν τὸ ποιεῖν, τὸ δὲ κελεῦσαι ῥάδιον
Commanding is easy, but performance ts hard.
Philemon, fragment. 
Literally: To do is hard, but to order is easy.

148. The future middle uses the stem of the future
active, but it has the same endings as the present middle.



In like manner inflect wéyrw, dyw, and eiw (§ 49).

149. ἔσομαι, the future of εἰμί, is inflected like παύσομαι
except in the third person singular of the indicative,
where the variable vowel ε is wanting.

Write out the future indicative, infinitive, and participle of εἰμί. Compare with paradigm (§ 538).

150. The aorist middle uses the stem of the aorist active
but it has the same endings as the imperfect middle. In
the second person singular, as in the imperfect, the o of
the ending drops out between two vowels, α + ο becom-
ing ω and ε + ο becoming ου.

151. First Aorist Inpicative Middle of παύω I stop

152. Second Aorist Inprcative Middle of λείπω I leave

153. Principal Parts of a Verb. Note that the first
principal part gives the stem on which are built all forms
of the present and imperfect ; the second gives the stem
for all forms of the future active and middle ; the third
gives the stem for all forms of the aorist active and
middle. Consult Grammatical Appendix (§ 548) for
further illustration of the function of the principal
parts.

154. Future Participle of Purpose. The future parti-
ciple expresses purpose, especially with verbs implying
motion. This is another use of the circumstantial parti-
ciple :

ἔπεμψε στρατιώτας ἀθροίσοντας τὰ ἐπιτήδεια 
he sent soldiers to gather provisions.

ESSON XXVIII

WORD STUDY. READING 
μέτρον ἄριστον. 
Moderation is best
Cleobulus, as quoted by Diogenes Laertius, I. 93.

160. Common Sense in Translation. In learning to read
our own language, we did not find it necessary to consult
the dictionary for every new word. Had we done so,
reading would have been an awful bore. The same is true
of reading Greek. The meaning of the new word is often
made unmistakable by the context.

Besides, words are likely to belong to “families.” The
vocabularies in this book have been so constructed as to
stress that fact. We should cultivate the habit of recognizing family traits. For example, in the passage that you
are about to read occur the two words αὐλητὴν (αὐλητοῦ)
and αὐλῆσαι. Neither is important enough to deserve a
place in a lesson vocabulary, and so the meaning of the
former is supplied in the text. You should easily catch the
family likeness to αὐλῆσαι and, recognizing the latter as
manifestly an aorist active infinitive, arrive at the correct
interpretation.

Not infrequently there exist related words in English.
If we are wide awake, we may discover them for ourselves.
But often such words are printed in parentheses as helps
to translation (for example, MELODY),

The recognition of English derivatives is helpful also not
only as a means of remembering the parent word in Greek



@89

but as shedding light upon the true meaning of the English
word itsclf (for example, SCHEME),

If these hints are followed, translation will consume less
time and produce more profit and enjoyment. There is a
thrill in realizing that we are growing in the power to stand
alone. Of course we must constantly ask ourselves, "Have
I made sense without doing violence to words or inflections,
and does my translation fit the passage ?”

163. Word-formation. Words often change their mean-
ing as they pass down the ages. The Greek épyéouas meant
ft dance. Its derivative ὀρχήστρᾶ meant a dancing-place.
This then came to be applied to that part of the theater
in which the chorus of the
Greek drama went throngh
its dances.

The space given over to
this dancing was flat and
circular, or nearly so. It
had a σκηνή,3 a dressing-booth, behind it and was
surrounded elsewhere by
rows of seats for specta-
tors.

In Roman days the orchestra no longer suggested dancing, being occupied by the seats of the wealthy.
It has a similar meaning to-day, but at times it refers to
the place immediately in front of the stage occupied by the
musicians. Most frequently it denotes such a group of
musicians, no matter where they may be.

LESSON XXIX

INTERROGATIVE AND INDEFINITE PRONOUNS

γηράσκω δ᾽ ἀεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος.
The older I grow, the more I learn.
Solon. 
Literally: I grow old ever learning many things.

164. The chief interrogative pronoun is τίς, τί who, what?
Except for the alternative forms τοῦ and τῷ, it always has
an acute on the first syllable. This never changes to a
grave.



165. The indefinite pronoun τις, τι some, any is the same
as τίς, τί in form but is always enclitic (§ 95).

Write out the inflection of τις, τι. Compare with paradigm (§ 524). 

166. Write with proper accents:

τινες ἐστε; τις ἐστιν ; ὁπλῑτας τινας, κωμη τις, ἀγγελοι
τινες, δωρον τι, δωρα τινα, ἁμαξων τινων.

167. The indefinite relative pronoun ὅστις, ἥτις, ὅ τι
whoever, whatever is formed by combining the relative ὅς 
(§ 67) and the indefinite τις, each part being inflected.
Exceptions appear in the alternative forms ὅτου, ὅτῳ, ὅτων.
ὅτοις, ἅττα of masculine and neuter, for which consult § 525

@92


In the neuter nominative and accusative singular ὅ τι
is printed as two words to distinguish it from ὅτι (that,

since, because). The accent of ὅς prevails, the τις being
enclitic.

Write out the inflection of  ὅστις, ἥτις, ὅ τι.

Compare with paradigm (§ 525).

168. Note the following relationships in form and meaning. They will be helpful when other words of a similar nature appear.

LESSON XXX

SUBJUNCTIVE ACTIVE

ῥᾷον παραινεῖν ἢ παθόντα καρτερεῖν.
It is easier to give advice than to bear one’s own ills.
Euripides, Alcestis, 1078. 
Literally: (It is) easier to advise than having
suffered to endure.


173. The subjunctive in all its tenses and voices uses the
same endings as the present indicative. Its variable vowel
is ω before μ or ν, elsewhere η.

174. The subjunctive uses the same stem as the corresponding tense and voice of the indicative.

Inflect the present and aorist subjunctive active of πέμπω, ἄγω,<n>Consult General Vocabulary.</n>
πείθω.

175. Contract Verbs in -εω have the ε absorbed before the
long vowels ω and η (§ 127, a). The accent follows the
principles laid down in § 127.4. Except for accent, φιλέω
is like παύω in the present subjunctive active.

Write out the inflection of the present subjunctive active
of φιλέω. Compare with paradigm (§ 534).

@95

176. Uses of the Subjunctive. (a) The subjunctive as
the main verb and in the first person (generally plural)
denotes exhortation.

This independent usage always refers to future time.
Present and aorist differ in that the present denotes continued or repeated action (motion picture), while the aorist
denotes simple occurrence (snapshot):

παύωμεν let us be stopping ;

παύσωμεν let us stop.
The negative is μή.

(b) ἵνα (ὡς or ὅπως) may introduce a subjunctive to express purpose. The tense values are as in §176, a. This
is the regular construction after a present or future tense:

ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν ἵνα σπεύδωσι πρὸς τὴν κώμην 
they do this that they may be hastening to the village ;

ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν ἵνα σπεύσωσι πρὸς τὴν κώμην 
they do this that they may hasten to the village.

The negative is μή.

177. VOCABULARY

ἀναγκάζω, ἀναγκάσω, ἠνάγκασα: compel.
οὔτε . . . οὔ-τε, neg. conj.: neither nor.


ἀνάγκη: necessity. 

πάσχω, πείσομαι, ἔπαθον: be treated, experience, suffer. SYMPATHY.

ἵνα, conj. adv. : that, in order that, 

μη(κ)ἔτι,1 2 adv.: no longer, never again.


ὅπως, conj. adv.: how, in order that, etc.

μήτε, neg. conj.: neither...nor.



τε, enclit. conj.: and. Usually followed by kai: both .. . and.

φέρω, οἴσω, ἤνεγκα: bear, carry. CHRISTOPHER.

ὡς, conj adv.: how, in order that, that, ete.; also as.



1 is due to analogy with οὐκ-έτι (§ 161).
2 The distinction between the compound torms of μή and οὐ is the same as that between μή and οὐ themselves.

time (compare with particular conditions, § 83, a, which
refer to definite and usually single acts):

ἐὰν ταῦτα βουλεύηται, ἀδικεῖ 
if ever he plans this, he does wrong.

If the apodosis contains a future indicative or its equivalent, the condition is future more vivid (the Greek makes
no distinction between particular and general conditions in future time):

ἐὰν ταῦτα βουλεύηται, ἀδικήσει. 
if he plans (shall plan) this, he will do wrong.

LESSON XXXII

OPTATIVE ACTIVE

τίς δὲ βώς, τί δὲ τερπνὸν ἄτερ χρυσῆς Ἀφροδέτης;
What life, what joy without golden Aphrodite 
Mimnermus

187. The optative has ι (sometimes ιη) as its mood
sign; in the third person plural it has ιε. This sign is
added to the variable vowel ο in the present and the second aorist. The secondary personal endings (as in the
imperfect) are then attached, except in the first person
singular, where -μι is used. Final -οι in the optative is
always long (§ V, a).

188. Present Optative of παύω I stop


Ssconp Aorist Optative of λείπω I leave



189. The future optative is the same as that of the present except for the stem. Inflect παύω in the future optative active and compare with paradigm ($ 526).

190. In the first aorist optative likewise the ι is added
to the stem, but the longer forms given for the second and
third persons singular and the third person plural are reg-
ularly used in Attic Greek. Final -αι in the optative is
always long (§ V, a).

First Aorist Oprative or παύω I stop


191. Contract Verbs have ιη as the sign of the optative
in the singular. The regular rules for contraction and
accent apply (§ 127). εἰμί also has ih in the singular.
It has ε as its stem.

Write the inflection of the present optative active of
φιλέω and εἰμί. Compare with paradigms ($§ 534, 538).

Inflect the present, future, and aorist optative active of
πέμπω, ἄγω, πείθω, ποιέω.

192. Uses of the Optative. (a) The optative when
used alone or with εἴθε or ef γάρ expresses a wish that
refers to the future. As in the subjunctive (§ 176, a),
present and aorist respectively denote continued action
(motion picture) and mere occurrence (snapshot) of an
act: devyor may he be fleeing ;

φεύγοι may he flee.
φύγοι negative is 7.

(6) ἵνα (ὡς or ὅπως) may introduce an optative to express purpose. The tense values are as in §176,a. The
optative appears only after a past tense or its equivalent;
but even then the subjunctive sometimes appears and
shows that special emphasis rests on the purpose: 1 

ταῦτα ἐποίουν ἵνα σπεύδοιεν πρὸς τὴν κώμην
they were doing this that they might be hastening to the village

ταῦτα ἐποίουν ἵνα σπεύσειαν πρὸς τὴν κώμην
they were doing this that they might hasten to the village


The negative is μή.



1 The mood of the verb in the purpose clause is the m as when the purpose was originally conceived and brings the original form and thought
vividly to the attention of the hearer or reader.
