<head>DECLENSION OF ο-STEMS</head>

ἐν ἀρχῇ ἢν ὁ λόγος.
In the beginning was the word.
John, 1.1

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="1"><p>Declensions. There are three declensions in Greek,
instead of five asin Latin. To these, because of their general uniformity, the o-stems serve as a good introduction.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="2"><p>Ο-Stem Masculines. Nouns of the ο-declension
whose nominatives end in -ος are usually masculine.

ὁ ποταμός the river


In like manner inflect ὁ ἀδελφός.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="3"><p>Accents.
(a) In nouns of the ο-declension an acute

(´) on the ultima in the ueminative is changed to a
circumflex (῀) in the genitive and dative of both numbers.





2 The letters N G D A prefixed to the various forms indicate respectively
nominative, genitive, dative, accusative. Inasmuch as this will be the invariable order of presentation, it is thought unnecessary to print these letters
in succeeding lessons. The vocative is not included in the forms to be memorized; nor is the dual.

3 Endings of masculines of the o-declension in Latin.
<pb n="2"/>


(b) An acute on the ultima changes to a grave (`)
when a word follows without intervening punctuation:

ἀδελφὸν ἔχει 
he has a brother.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="4"><p>Cases. The endings of a noun tell its case and use

(a) The nominative is the case of the subject:

οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἦσαν ἀδελφοί the generals were brothers.

(2) The genitive suggests relations like those expressed

with of in English. It frequently denotes possession :
ὁ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ ἀδελφός 
the brother of the yeneral.

(c) The dative suggests relations like those with fo or
for in English. It frequently denotes the indirect object :
τῷ στρατηγῷ πέμπει τὸν ἀδελφόν 
he sends his brother to the general.

(d) The accusative is the direct object of a transitive
verb: ἀδελφὸν πέμπει he sends a brother.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="5"><p>The Article.
(a) Like English, and unlike Latin,
Greek has a definite article. This agrees with its noun
in gender, number, and case. It often serves as a possessive pronoun, as my, your, his, etc. ὁ and οἱ are proclitic
(page xxvii). 

(b) Greek has no indefinite article. Many nouns having no definite article require a or an in translation:</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="6"><p>VOCABULARY
ἀδελφός, -οὔ, δ: brother.  PHILADELPHIA.

ἔχει: he, she, or it has,
ἔχουσι: they have.
ἦν: he, she, it, or there was.
ἦσαν: they or there were.
παύει; he, she, or it stops (transitive).

παύουσι: they stop.
πέμπει: he, she, or it sends (transitive).
πέμπουσι: they send.

to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).

3 Endings of feminines of the a-declension in Latin.

4 For the accent of all forms of κώμη and μάχη except the genitive plural.
see§ V, f. The genitive plural of α-stems originally ended in -α(σ)ων, Latin
-arum. Therefore, words of this declension regularly circumflex the ultima
of the genitive plural because of contraction of vowels.

<p>Position of Adjectives.
(a) When an adjective or
an adjective phrase accompanies a noun with a definite
article, the adjective usually stands between the article
and the noun, as in English:

ὁ δίκικος ἄνθρωπος the just man.

Note that (unlike English) even a prepositional phrase
may stand in this position:
οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἄνθρωποι or οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ1 the men in the village.

The adjective may also follow the noun and have the article repeated with it:
ὃ ἄνθρωπος ὃ δίκαιος the Just man.

In the above instances the adjective or phrase is said to
have the attributive position.

(b) When an adjective precedes the article or follows
the article and the noun without the article being repeated, it is said to stand in the predicate position:

δίκαιος ὁ ἄνθρωπος or ὁ ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος the man (is) just. </p></div>

changes in meanings of words. Words are living creatures and as such they coristantly acquire new characteristics and new aptitudes as they adjust themselves to new conditions.

Thus σκηνή, tent or booth, was originally used of the tent or
booth into which an actor withdrew to change his costume.
When the theater became more elaborate, σκηνή referred to the
wall that served as support for painted scenery. From this it
was but a step to σκηνή meaning the scene of an action.

<p>Word-formation.
(a) A very common means of
forming adjectives is by adding to the stem of a noun
the suffix -ιος, -ίᾱ, -ιον, which appears frequently in English as -ian. O-stems drop the o before this suffix, α-stems retain the α to form the diphthong αι:

φίλος friend, φίλιος friendly;
but Ἀθῆναι Athens, Ἀθηναῖος Athenian.

(2) From δίκαιον and πολέμιος construct the corresponding nouns; from ἵππος and ἀγορά construct the corresponding adjectives.

<p>The Future Tense. This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding o to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form y (πσ) ;

2. A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form & (κσ);

3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:

πέμπω, πέμψω; 
ἄγω, ἄξω; 
ἀθροίζω (ἀθροιδ-), ἀθροίσω.

In most instances, the stem is readily recognized in the

<p>The Aorist. Aorist is the name of a tense of the
Greek verb. The name is not used in the inflection of
Latin or English verbs, but many of its functions are
entirely familiar.

The aorist indicative in Greek expresses a single act (that
is, not continued or repeated) in past time. It gives, as
it were, a snapshot of past action, while the imperfect gives 
a motion picture: 

ἔπαυον I was stopping; ἔπαυσα I stopped.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="55">
<p>Formation of the Aorist.
(a) The aorist, in common with other secondary tenses, in the indicative has
augment and secondary endings (§§ 42, 43).

<pb n="31"/>
(b) The distinguishing feature of the first aorist is the
suffix σα (σε in the third singular), which obeys the same
phonetic laws as the σ of the future (§ 49).

(c) The first aorist infinitive active is always accented on the penult:1 ἀθροῖσαι, ἁρπάσαι.

(d) Some verbs lack a first aorist. Such verbs often have a second aorist, a distinguishing feature of which is a
weakening of the vowel element of thestem, The second aorist indicative is inflected like the imperfect, and the corresponding infinitive has an ending like that of the present infinitive, but it is accented irregularly on the ultima: 
ἄγω, ἤγαγον, ἀγαγεῖν;
λείπω, ἔλιπον, λιπεῖν;
φεύγω, ἔφυγον, φυγεῖν.
(e) The third form in the principal parts of a normal
verb shows by the presence of -σα (-α)2 or -ον whether the
aorist is first or second.

Inflect λύω and φεύγω in the aorist indicative and infinitive.</p></div>

<p>PRONUNCIATION OF ANGLICIZED GREEK PROPER NAMES

(a) Every educated person should know how to pronounce correctly the many Greek proper names that have
passed into English literature and English speech. Especially is this to be expected of every person who has been
privileged to study Greek.

(4) Here are a few simple rules which will help:

1. Because most Greek proper names have come into English via Latin, custom demands first that the Greek letters shali


<pb n="39"/>

be replaced by their Latin equivalents.



These can be learned from

§§ I and II, but note especially that 
αι passes into  or e, 
ει into î or ê, 
οι into oe or ê 
(when final, οι becomes î), 
ου into û, 
υ into y (except in diphthongs), 
ος into us:

Θησεῖον Theseum, 
Φοῖβος Phoebus,
Φίλιπποι Philippi, 
Ἐπίκουρος Epicurus,

Αἴσχυλος Aischylus, 
Αἰθιοπία Ethiopia, 
Ἀριστείδης Aristides,
Κύκλωψ Cyclops,

Φοῖνιξ Phoenician

2. Use the ordinary English sounds for the letters, remembering that c (for k) and g are “soft” before e or i sounds.

3. Names that have become  very common in English are likely to have lost or changed their inflectional endings:

Ἀθῆναι Athens,  
Συράκουσαι Syracuse, 
Ὅμηρος Homer, 
Πλάτων Plato, 
Ἀλέξανδρος Alexander.

Bronze Boy FROM MARATHON

This head belongs to a beautiful statue found in almost perfect condition by a fisherman in the Bay of Marathon in 1925.

4. The anglicized form is to
be accented according to the
Latin rules: two-syllabled
words accent the penult; poly-syllables accent the penult, if
long, otherwise the antepenult:
A'thens, Ody'sseus, Pene'lope.1

(c) Transliterate into English and pronounce :

Κυθέρεια 
Ἀγαμέμνων 
Βορέᾱς 
Κῦρος
Ἡρόδοτος 
Ἀφροδίτη <note>Final η, when transliterated inta é, is regularly sounded.</note>
Θουκυδίδης 
Ἀπόλλων
Ζεύς 
Χάρων 
Σωκράτης 
Λυκοῦργος

(a) Words other than proper names have suffered still greater changes as to ending:

φιλοσοφίᾳ philosophy

ἄγγελος angel, 
ὠκεανός ocean,


σπασμός spasm,



φιλόσοφος philosopher,

<p>THE PHALANX

By means of the phalanx, invented and developed by
Greeks, Alexander the Great imposed his will upon most
of the civilized world. In the hands of the Romans, who
were quick to grasp its possibilities, it grew into the famous
legion.


“The average depth of the phalanx was eight men,
although it occasionally reached sixteen, even before the
time of the Macedonians. Epaminondas made his left
wing about fifty ranks deep. The spear might be twenty-one feet long, or even twenty-four in Hellenistic times.
Five or six rows of spear points would project beyond the
front rank making an impenetrable barrier. The spears
of the rear ranks rested upon the shoulders of men in front
with their points directed upward. The formation looked
like a huge porcupine with the quills pointing in one
direction. The Roman consul, Lucius Aemilius, a seasoned
veteran, confessed to friends at Rome that he had never
seen anything more terrible and alarming than the Macedonian phalanx of Perseus.”

manner, means, cause, condition, concession, or any attendant
circumstances of an action.

THe ERECHTHEUM
On the spot where Athena contended with Poseidon for the guardianship
of Athens, stands the most elegant of all Greek temples. Near one end
grew the sacred olive of the goddess. Within the shrine was her ancient
wooden image. Beneath the north porch are still shown the marks of
Poseidon's trident. (See the pictures on page 334 and facing page 180.)</p></div>

<p>Word-formation. Verbs formed by adding -έω to
noun (or adjective) stems denote action of a nature similar to that expressed by the noun (or adjective). They 
usually denote a condition or an activity:

φίλος friend, φιλέω be a friend, love ;
πόλεμος war, πολεμέω make war;
ἄδικος unjust, ἀδικέω he unjust, do wrong.

This type of verb is to be found chiefly in connection
with words of the ο-declension.

<p>Common Sense in Translation. In learning to read
our own language, we did not find it necessary to consult
the dictionary for every new word. Had we done so,
reading would have been an awful bore. The same is true
of reading Greek. The meaning of the new word is often
made unmistakable by the context.

Besides, words are likely to belong to “families.” The
vocabularies in this book have been so constructed as to
stress that fact. We should cultivate the habit of recognizing family traits. For example, in the passage that you
are about to read occur the two words αὐλητὴν (αὐλητοῦ)
and αὐλῆσαι. Neither is important enough to deserve a
place in a lesson vocabulary, and so the meaning of the
former is supplied in the text. You should easily catch the
family likeness to αὐλῆσαι and, recognizing the latter as
manifestly an aorist active infinitive, arrive at the correct
interpretation.

Not infrequently there exist related words in English.
If we are wide awake, we may discover them for ourselves.
But often such words are printed in parentheses as helps
to translation (for example, MELODY),

The recognition of English derivatives is helpful also not
only as a means of remembering the parent word in Greek

but as shedding light upon the true meaning of the English
word itsclf (for example, SCHEME),

If these hints are followed, translation will consume less
time and produce more profit and enjoyment. There is a
thrill in realizing that we are growing in the power to stand
alone. Of course we must constantly ask ourselves, "Have
I made sense without doing violence to words or inflections,
and does my translation fit the passage ?”</p></div>

<p>Word-formation. Words often change their mean-
ing as they pass down the ages. The Greek épyéouas meant
ft dance. Its derivative ὀρχήστρᾶ meant a dancing-place.
This then came to be applied to that part of the theater
in which the chorus of the
Greek drama went throngh
its dances.

The space given over to
this dancing was flat and
circular, or nearly so. It
had a σκηνή,3 a dressing-booth, behind it and was
surrounded elsewhere by
rows of seats for specta-
tors.

In Roman days the orchestra no longer suggested dancing, being occupied by the seats of the wealthy.
It has a similar meaning to-day, but at times it refers to
the place immediately in front of the stage occupied by the
musicians. Most frequently it denotes such a group of
musicians, no matter where they may be.

to neun or verb stems, form adjectives that have a nega-
tive meaning :5

ἀ-διάβα-τος not to he crossed, not crossable, ἄ-δικος unjust.

(b) In like manner form adjectives meaning: (1) unworthy ; (2) obscure, doubtful; (3) godless, atheistic ;
(4) without gifts, incorruptible ; (5) without war, unwarlike; (8) without place, out of the way, strange; (7) without food ; (8) friendless. Compare A-SEPTIC, AN-HYDROUS, AN-ARCHIC, A-PATHETIC.



1 Continued from Lesson XXL.

2 ἀδικέω admits of two accusatives, one of the person affected, the other of
the thing done. If the verb is used in the passive, the former becomes subject, the latter is kept in the accusative.

3 Doriv genitive of the α-declension.

4 Although γάρ usually may be translated for, not infrequently it is
equivalent to the exclamatory why.

5 These adjectives are of two endings and have recessive accent: ἀδιάβατος, ἀδιάβατον (§ 510, b).

<p>Conditional Relative Clauses. A relative pronoun
or adverb may take the place of εἰ in the protasis of a con-
dition. If ἐάν is the normal introductory word, the relative is accompanied by av: 

ὅστις = εἰ, ὅστις ἄν = ἐάν.

A relative used in this way has an indefinite antecedent,
expressed or implied. The negative of the protasis is
always μή. 

The ἄν is often combined with an introductory relative
adverb:

<p>THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS

One of the most notable features of Greek geography
is the presence of the sea. Few countries with so limited
a territory have had so
extensive a coastline.
The sea gave the people
a livelihood, afforded
the best means of access
not only to their Greek 
neighbors but to the
world at large, and
both by its perils and
by its rewards stimu-
lated their intellect. No
wonder, then, that their
literature is filled with
allusions to seafaring
and to the beauty and :
the terrors of the deep.

Many of these words have passed over into English with
slight change:

πράττω (stem πρᾱγ-) do, πρᾱκτικός PRACTICAL;
ἀνα-λύω analyze, ἀναλυτικός ANALYTICS
σήπω decay, σηπτικός SEPTIC.



1 For ἐστι: ; in elision τ becomes θ before rough breathing.

(6)-κος, -ικος when added to noun stems make adjec-
tives that denote relation, fitness, or ability:

φύσις nature, φυσικός PHYSICAL;
πολίτης citizen, πολῑτικός POLITICAL.

(e) Frequently in English -al (from Latin -alis) is added
to -ic or -tic. Sometiines both forms occur: comic, comical ;
electric, electrical.

(d) The neuter plurals of these adjectives were used in
Greek as names for the arts and sciences. Such words,
when taken into English, have the English -s instead of -a:

φυσικά PHYSICS, πολῑτικά POLITICS, ἤθικά ETHICS.

(e) The Greeks sometimes also used the singular, which
we have imitated in English. It was in agreement with
an implied téyyn art, or ériotypn science:

μουσική MUSIC, ἀριθμητική ARITHMETIC, ῥητορική RHETORIC.


(f) Give at least two English derivatives akin to each

<p>Finite Moods in Indirect Discourse. λέγω (in active
voice), εἶπον, ἀποκρίνομαι, and certain other verbs of like
meaning are followed by a clause introduced by ὅτι that,
or ὡς (how) that. The verb in the subordinate clause
has the same mood and tense that it would have if quoted
directly; but after a secondary tense it may take the optaive (tense always remaining the same). Retention of
the original mood after a secondary tense produces vividness:

εἶπεν ὅτι παρέσοιτο he said that he would be present.

παρέσομαι I shall be present. was the original form and
might remain as πταρέσται, producing vividness.</p></div>

<p>Indirect Questions. A verb indicating a question is
followed by an interrogative or an indirect relative and a

πυνθάνεται τί ἔσται αὐτῷ 
he asks what he shall have ;

ἐπυνθάνετο τί ἔσοιτο (or ἔσται) αὐτῷ 
he asked what he should have.



1 Such verbs are for the most part those meaning to see, perceive, hear,
learn, know, be ignorant of, remember, forget, show, appear, prove, and

<f>THE DELPHIC ORACLE

Review carefully §§ 68 and 160.

The shrine of Apollo at Delphi was the must influential religious
center in the ancient world. Belonging not to a single state but to
all Greeks, it enjoyed their joint protection and patronage.

The god was supposed to make answer through the lips of his
priestess, who, inspired by a vapor that issued from a fissure in the
rock beneath the temple, uttered cries which were interpreted in
verse by the attendant priests.

μῦθος myth, story, 
μυθολόγος storyteller, 
μυθολογίᾱ MYTHOLOGY. 

Note carefully that the words in -ology are not derived
from λόγος but from λέγω. The -ιᾱ denotes that about
which a particular person speaks. 

(b) Add two words in -ography and two in -ology to
the above list, consulting an unabridged English diction-
ary to discover if the entire word comes from the Greek
or whether it is a hybrid like sociology.

(c) From these compound nouns, verbs were formed
in classic Greek by adding -εω. In later Greek -ιζω was
so used, and in English we use this ending -ize (-ise) with
great frequency, even attaching it to stems that have no
connection with Greek :

ἀστρονομίζω astronomize ; in English CIVILIZE, ANGLICIZE.

(d) Add two words which an unabridged English dictionary shows are derived in this way.

Spartan has always been synonymous with the simplicity,

<f>“Hollow Lacedaemon "

The lovely valley of Sparta needed no defense except its valiant soldiers.</f>

Far inferior in number to their neighbors, many of whem
they had reduced to serfdom, the Spartans were forced to
maintain their status by threat of arms. They entered military school at an early age and their best years were spent
in barracks or on campaign. Such an environment discouraged individualism and fostered patriotism. Their literature consisted chiefly of choral songs suited to the mess-hall 
er the campfire, or to religious gatherings.

Tyrteus, is said to have been a lame schoolmaster sent by

people among whom he dwelt. Two of his poems follow.

(a) The perfect denotes
completed action with the effect of the action still continuing at the time of speaking or writing:

(b) The perfect often stresses the lasting result with
little or no reference to the act of completion. It is then

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="321">
<p>Reduplication is the sign of the perfect, whether
active, middle, or passive, and is found in every perfect. It has different forms:
(a) Verbs beginning with a single consonant prefix this

consonant and ε to the stem:

παύω, πέπαυκα.
φ is represented by a, 8 by t, x by k:
φαίνω, πέφηνα ; θνήσκω, τέθνηκα.

(b) Verbs beginning with a mute and a liquid (Introduction I, d) usually reduplicate like those beginning with a single consonant.

γράφω, γέγραφα.

(c) Verbs beginning with a vowel, a double consonant
or ρ,1 or with two or more consonants other than a mute
and a liquid, have a reduplication identical with augment:

ἁρπάζω, ἥρπακα ; ζητέω, ἐζήτηκα ; στρατεύω, ἐστράτευκα.</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="322">
<p>The perfect active of most verbs is formed by add-
ing -κα (-κε) to the reduplicated stem; of other verbs
(especially those with mute or liquid stems) by adding -α
(-ε). Perfects in -κα (-κε) are called first perfects; those
in -α (-ε) second perfects. Second perfects may best be
learned from the principal parts. Except for the κ, they
have the same inflection as first perfects.2</p></div>

<div type="textsection" subtype="para" n="323">
<p>The pluperfect prefixes a syllabic augment when the
teduplivated perfect begins with a consonant. Otherwise
it retains the reduplicated stem unchanged:

πέφηνα, ἐπεφήνη ; ἔσταλκα, ἐστάλκη.

Note the accents of the infinitive and participle. They are typical
of these forms and often serve as clues.



1 Verbs beginning with ρ double the ρ.
2 The second perfect usually shows the mute of the stem in its rough form:
π and β become φ; κ and γ become χ; τ and β become θ.

α-declension in the feminine. The stems should be noted:
ν is absent before τ in the masculine and neuter; also υι

accusative singular. The absence of ν or the presence of
υι serve as clues.

<p>The first aorist passive forms its stem by adding θη
(in indicative and infinitive) or θε (in subjunctive, optative,

<p>GREEK VIEWS ON DEATH

(a) Socrates at the age of seventy was tried in Atheng
on a charge of impiety. The spirit that pervades his
defense, as recorded by Plato in
the Apology, is sufficient proof
to modern minds that he was in-
nocent; but he was condemned
to death. Among other notable
utterances addressed to friends
and foes after the verdict, is the
following characteristic state-
ment of his creed.

Ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑμᾶς χρή, ὦ ἄνδρες
δικασταί, εὐ-ἐλπιδας εἶναι πρὸς
τὸν θάνατον, καὶ ἕν τι τοῦτο

<p>Word-formation. Reference has already been made
(§ 210) to certain ways in which Greek technical terms
originated. Frequently the word as then used still ap-
plies. The Greeks would understand us if they heard us
speak of arithmetic, ethics, dialectics, oligarchy.



Sometimes, however, the idea has changed, while the
word has remained the same. Reference has been made
to seene (§ 35) and orchestra (§ 163). Economy to the
Greek was restricted to the house.

Again, modern inventions have introduced ideas unknown before and terms with meanings previously impossible. Hydrostatic might have been intelligible to the
ancient Greek, but static in the radio is a coinage of very
recent date, whose meaning would be unintelligible to
one unfamiliar with radio. At times these new adaptations of Greek words are in accord with the original
meaning and an ancient Greek would have guessed what
telephone or photograph meant without really understanding the things thus labeled. At other times the
adaptations have done more or less violence to the original
meaning and no Greek could have any idea of the modern
meaning of his word museum (once a temple dedicated to
the Muses). He would have shuddered to hear of such
hybrids as wattmeter or speedometer, just as he would
have required time to accustom himself to sociology or
automobile.

Even words that are now venerable and apparently good
Greek may be of non-Greek origin. Metaphysics would
have meant nothing to Aristotle. The Romans used the
term to describe that part of Aristotle’s works which came
after (μετά) his “ Physics.” Later, it came to describe
works of a similar nature and even a distinct phase of
philosophy.

<p>Word-formation. In passing down the ages, words
often become corrupted in form but retain approximately
their original meaning. σατο overseer became the
title of an officer of the church and through careless speech
passed into bishop. ἐλεημοσύνη became Latin eleemosyna,
then Anglo-Saxon aedmesse, finally alms. σκίουρος shady-tailed became the Latin sciurus, seturellus, and today is
squirrel. Byzantium was the city through a long period
and people spoke of going εἰς τὴν πόλιν until finally it
was called Stamboul. Stamboul is now the native section
of Constantinople, Constantine’s πόλις. ἡ καλὴ πόλις has

<p>ONE ADVENTURE AMONG MANY 

In his so-called True story, Lucian takes the hero 
and his shipmates to a sea resembling the Sargasso Sea

reached the ears of Lucian is not known, but in any event
his imagination left reality far behind. He tells us that
the voyagers hauled their ship to the tree tops and,
spreading sail, skimmed aiong the branches as if on
water. He goes on to say:

<p>GREEK INFLUENCE

Under the plastic touch of conquered Greece, the
Latin language was gradually moulded into an apter instrument, while the Roman intellect itself acquired, in
some measure, a flexibility not native to it.

R. C. Jebb, Essays and Addresses.

Clearness of vision, cheerfulness of acceptance, easy 
grace of expression, are the qualities which delight us;
and now when we affirm that we find all these in the
genuine Grecian works, achieved in the noblest material,
the best proportioned form, with certainty and completeness of execution, we shall be understood if we always
refer to them as a basis and a standard. Let each be a
Grecian in his own way, but let him be one.

than that, it is an epic of human life.

from his wife and child. A detail of the scene follows.

At first the child shrinks back with a shriek, being frightened
by his father’s gorgeous helinet. With a laugh Hector removes the
helmet and the child comes to him.

<p>The Iliad has had an incalculable influence on the
literature of the world. It has been read in the schools
by boys of all nations from the earliest days of Greece to
the present time. Greek poets quoted it, Latin poets borrowed from it, most modern poets have attempted to translate it. Keats bears eloquent testimony to his own feelings:

ON FIRST LOOKING INTO CHAPMAN’S HOMER

Much have I travell’d in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been

Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.

Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
That deep-brow’d Homer ruled as his demesne:
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene

Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold :

Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken;

O, like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
He star’d at the Pacific -— and all his men 

Look’d at each other with a wild surmise --
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
