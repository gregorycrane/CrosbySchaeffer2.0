Contract Verbs.
(a) Two successive vowels are
regularly contracted into one long vowel or diphthong :

ε+ω=ω;
ε+ο ου =—0v;
ε+ε= ει.

ε is always absorbed by a long vowel or diphthong.

(b) If the first of the contracting syllables is accented,
the resultant syllable receives a circumflex ;

φιλέω, φιλῶ.

In other tenses than the present (and imperfect) the
final ε of the stem is regularly lengthened to η:

φιλέω, φιλήσω, ἐφίλησα.

Genitive Absolute. A noun or pronoun in the
genitive case with a circumstantial participle in agreement may stand grammatically independent of the rest of
the sentence. This is called the genitive absolute and corresponds to the ablative absolute in Latin and the nominative independent (absolute) in English.

Like any other use of the circumstantial participle, the
genitive absolute may express time, cause, and the like.
It is usually best translated as a clause :

>  Κύρου κελεύσαντος ταῦτα ἐποίησαν<br/> <quote xml:lang="eng">when Cyrus ordered, they did
this </quote> 
;
>  τούτων πράγματα παρ-εχόντων σπεύσομεν<br/> <quote xml:lang="eng">if they cause trouble, we
shall hasten </quote> <bibl></bibl>
;

τῶν φυλάκων διωκόντων ἔφυγεν with the guards pursuing, he fled.

<figure><head>THE ERECHTHEUM</head>
On the spot where Athena contended with Poseidon for the guardianship
of Athens, stands the most elegant of all Greek temples. Near one end
grew the sacred olive of the goddess. Within the shrine was her ancient
wooden image. Beneath the north porch are still shown the marks of
Poseidon's trident. (See the pictures on page 334 and facing page 180.)</figure>

Word-formation. Verbs formed by adding -έω to
noun (or adjective) stems denote action of a nature similar to that expressed by the noun (or adjective). They
usually denote a condition or an activity:

φίλος friend, φιλέω be a friend, love ;
πόλεμος war, πολεμέω make war;
ἄδικος unjust, ἀδικέω he unjust, do wrong.

This type of verb is to be found chiefly in connection
with words of the ο-declension.
