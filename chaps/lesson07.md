Feminines in ᾱ. If ε, ι, or ρ immediately precedes
the final vowel of the stem, words of the α-declension have
ᾱ, not η, throughout the singular.2

ἡ μικρὰ στρατιά the small army

Accusative of Extent. The accusative denotes extent
of space or duration of time :

διώξει τοὺς πολεμίους δέκα σταδίους
he will pursue the enemy ten stades.

διώξει τοὺς πολεμίους δέκα ἡμέρᾱς
he will pursue the enemy ten days.





2 A few feminines have short α in the nominative and accusative singular.
They will be treated later.

3 This is our third use of the accusative. What were the other two ?

1 Many Greek adjectives when preceded by the article are used as nouns, Compare English, the blind, a word to the wise; and the Greek, οἱ πολέμιοι.
2 As in English, Greek questions are sometimes introduced by an interrogative pronoun or adverb, but often the mark of interrogation at the end of a printed sentence is the only clue. This mark of interrogation in Greek is the same as the English semicolon (;).

<figure><head>THE ACROPOLIS</head>

Although many Greek cities had a fortified hill, or acropolis, most people
associate that word with the famous hi!l in the heart of Athens. At first the
home of the early kings, it came to be devoted to the gods and heroes of the
state. Its glorious temples were visible from the agora, as indeed for miles
around in all directions.</figure>

Word-formation.
(a) A very common means of
forming adjectives is by adding to the stem of a noun
the suffix -ιος, -ίᾱ, -ιον, which appears frequently in English as -ian. O-stems drop the o before this suffix, α-stems retain the α to form the diphthong αι:

φίλος friend, φίλιος friendly;
but Ἀθῆναι Athens, Ἀθηναῖος Athenian.

(2) From δίκαιον and πολέμιος construct the corresponding nouns; from ἵππος and ἀγορά construct the corresponding adjectives.
