The relative pronoun, ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, who, which, presents
nothing new in inflection, It is like ἀγαθός everywhere
except in the neuter nominative and accusative singular,
where it has the same endings as the article.

ὅς who, which

PARADIGM OF FORMS

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="68">


αὐτός *self*, and ἄλλος *other*, are inflected similarly
except that ἄλλος has the accent on the penult. Inflect
them and compare with paradigms (§§ 519 and 520).

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="69">


A relative pronoun, as in English and in Latin,
agrees with its antecedent in gender, number, and person,
but its case depends on the construction in its own clause.



In English, "who" is the nominative and "whom" is (still) the accusative (although the distinction is fading).

Thus, we say: "I saw the woman (object and would be accusative if we had an accusative) **who** (nominative) was teaching the class."



But we would say (in traditional English): "I saw the woman **whom** we both know."



In Greek we find:
| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ ἄγγελος ὃν ἔπεμψας ἐθέλει φυγεῖν  |  the messenger whom you sent wishes to flee.  |


## [§ 70](#para70). Uses of αὐτός.



Following the article, αὐτός means
same :

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἡ αὐτὴ κώμη  |  the same village,  |
When modifying a noun or pronoun, but not following
the article, αὐτός is an intensifier and can be translated as *self*;
| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  Κῦρος αὐτός  |  Cyrus himself;   |
|  ἡ κώμη αὐτή  |  the village itself;  |
|  αὐτὸς ἔφυγεν  |  he himself fled;  |
>  αὐτὸς γὰρ Θρασύμαχος ὁμολογεῖ τοὺς μὲν ἄρχοντας ἐνίοτε ἑαυτοῖς κακὰ προστάττειν, τοῖς δὲ δίκαιον εἶναι ταῦτα ποιεῖν<br/> <bibl>Plat. Rep. 340a</bibl>



standing alone, except in the
nominative, it is a personal pronoun of the third person:
<foreign>αὐτῷ ἔγραψα</foreign> I wrote to him,

<foreign>αὐτοὺς ἀθροίζει</foreign> he collects them.

# Chapter 13: Figure: AN ANCIENT TIMEPIECE



This Horologium, or Tower of the Winds, stood in the Agora and served
as both weather bureau and town clock. It was surmounted by a weather-
vane. Sundials adorned the exterior, and within was a water clock. The
figures beneath the cornice represent the eight winds.
