*Eager to Go*: Pedestal of the monument dedicated to the victory of Krates in the Apobates (literally,"the person who gets off") race at the Panathenaic Games. A fully armed soldier jumps on and off a moving chariot. The image above is a marble relief from the fourth century BCE and is at the Acropolo Athens, Greece.

This book provides a hybrid approach to learning Ancient that integrates traditional methods with the capabilities provided by digital media. In print culture, readers of ancient languages depended upon static texts that coud not explain themselves. Consider a fairly straightforward line from the Iliad.


>  ὅσσά μοι ἠνείκαντο ἀέθλια μώνυχες ἵπποι.<br/>
>  However many prizes my solid-hoofed horses won for me.<br/>

Changes include the following:


1. **Readers can now go from inflected words to their regularized dictionary forms (which we call "lemmas").** Thus, the Greek form <foreign>ἠνείκαντο</foreign> <gloss>they won for me</gloss> is actually a form of the verb <foreign>φέρω</foreign>, even though the two words bear no resemblance to each other. Forms from different verbs became combined over time and thus it is impossible for any reader to deduce that <foreign>ἠνείκαντο</foreign> is a form of <foreign>φέρω</foreign>. A whole genre of dictionary cross-references and even reference works emerged to help people match irregular forms with their lemmas but, as most of those who depended entirely on print to learn Greek, these were imperfect and often failed to provide the answer.
2. **Readers can now go directly from an inflected form to multiple online dictionaries for Ancient Greek.**. In the case of Homer,




If readers could not identify the dictionary form (the lemma) of an inflected form on the page, they had no recourse.

Greek contains five diacritics.


Three of these describe pitch:

| Accent | Example | 
| --- | --- 
| acute -- a rising tone | ποταμός | 
| grave -- a sinking tone | ποταμὸς | 
| circumflex -- a tone that rises and falls | Κῦρον | 




The other two diacritics tell you whether or not a word beginning with a vowel has an 'h.' Greek ceased to use the letter 'h.' To show whether a word is aspirated (starts with an 'h') it uses what are called breathing marks.

| | | 
| --- | --- | --- 
| "rough" breathing (with an 'h') | ὁ | ho | 
| "smooth" breathing (no 'h') | ἀπὸ | apo | 


The breathing marks are often very hard to make out on a computer screen. In practice, we should only show one breathing mark (i.e., for either rough or smooth) but that is not how Greek texts are printed.
