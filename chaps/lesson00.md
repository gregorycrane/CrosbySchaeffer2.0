**Eager to Go**: Pedestal of the monument dedicated to the victory of Krates in the Apobates (literally,"the person who gets off") race at the Panathenaic Games.

>  Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης, νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος· ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσθένει Δαρεῖος καὶ ὑπώπτευε τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου, ἐβούλετο τὼ παῖδε ἀμφοτέρω παρεῖναι.<br/>

The state of the art of large-scale assisted reading for Greek and Latin in print culture was side-by-side translation, as in the Loeb Classical Library.

Greek contains five diacritics.


Three of these describe pitch:

| Accent | Example | 
| --- | --- 
| acute -- a rising tone | ποταμός | 
| grave -- a sinking tone | ποταμὸς | 
| circumflex -- a tone that rises and falls | Κῦρον | 




The other two diacritics tell you whether or not a word beginning with a vowel has an 'h.' Greek ceased to use the letter 'h.' To show whether a word is aspirated (starts with an 'h') it uses what are called breathing marks.

| Greek | Translit. | 
| --- | --- 
| "rough" breathing (with an 'h') | ὁ | ho | 
| "smooth" breathing (no 'h') | ἀπὸ | apo | 


The breathing marks are often very hard to make out on a computer screen. In practice, we should only show one breathing mark (i.e., for either rough or smooth) but that is not how Greek texts are printed.
