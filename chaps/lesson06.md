Α-Stem Feminines. Α-declension nouns whose
nominatives end in ᾱ or η are feminine. Because the
feminine article shows η in the singular, nouns and adjectives in η are presented first.<note n="GRC">this makes no sense if you have not learned the next chapter -- it only works for teachers</note> Both types are the same
in the plural

ἡ καλὴ σκηνή the beautiful tent


κώμη village


In like manner inflect ἡ φυγή and ἡ μάχη.4

What forms of the α-declension have the same ending as the corresponding form of the ο-declension? What have similar endings?

Adjectives.
(a) Adjectives of the ο- and α-declensions have three endings, one for each gender. [Likewise,
Latin has three endings, one for masculine, feminine and neuter, e.g., bonus, bona, bonum, "good".]


2 For the accent of ἡ, καλή, and σκηνή, see § V, g, h, and i.

3 Endings of feminines of the α-declension in Latin.

4 For the accent of all forms of κώμη and μάχη except the genitive plural.
see§ V, f. The genitive plural of α-stems originally ended in -α(σ)ων [Latin
-arum]. Therefore, words of this declension regularly circumflex the ultima
of the genitive plural because of contraction of vowels.

(b) Such adjectives accent the feminine genitive plural
like the genitive plural of the o-declension.

Inflect in all three genders ἀγαθός and δῆλος. Compare with paradigms, § 510, a.

Position of Adjectives.
(a) When an adjective or
an adjective phrase accompanies a noun with a definite
article, the adjective usually stands between the article
and the noun, as in English:

ὁ δίκαιος ἄνθρωπος the just man.

Note that (unlike English) even a prepositional phrase
may stand in this position:
οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἄνθρωποι or οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ1 the men in the village.

The adjective may also follow the noun and have the article repeated with it:
ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ δίκαιος the Just man.

In the above instances the adjective or phrase is said to
have the attributive position.

(b) When an adjective precedes the article or follows
the article and the noun without the article being repeated, it is said to stand in the predicate position:

δίκαιος ὁ ἄνθρωπος or ὁ ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος the man (is) just.

Dative of Possession. In English we say There is no lid to the box. The Latin says <foreign xml:lang="lat">Puero est gladius</foreign>, <gloss>the boy has a sword</gloss>. So in Greek the dative is used to denote
the possessor, while the thing possessed is subject of the
verb to be:

φυλακὴ οὐκ ἦν τῇ κώμῃ
the village had no garrison,



1 With an expression like this ἄνθρωποι is implied.
2 This is our fourth use of the dative. What were the other three?

Word-formation. It is interesting to follow the
changes in meanings of words. Words are living creatures and as such they coristantly acquire new characteristics and new aptitudes as they adjust themselves to new conditions.

Thus σκηνή, tent or booth, was originally used of the tent or
booth into which an actor withdrew to change his costume.
When the theater became more elaborate, σκηνή referred to the
wall that served as support for painted scenery. From this it
was but a step to σκηνή meaning the scene of an action.
