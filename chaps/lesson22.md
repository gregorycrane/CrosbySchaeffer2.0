feminine is regular.

usually has the predicate qgosition (§ 31, 6) and means

(b) πᾶς in the attributive position (§ 31, a) means
the whole (the entire number or amount) :

ἡ πᾶσα ὁδός the whole road, the entire road.

(c) was without an article means all (conceivable) or
every:
πᾶσαι ὁδοί all roads ;

## [§ 125](#para125). Precision of Thought.


“The practice of translation, by making us deliberate in the choice of the best
equivalent of a foreign word in our own language, has
likewise the advantage of continually schooling us in one
of the main elements of a good style, — precision ; and
precision of thought is not only exemplified by precision
of language, but is largely dependent on the habit of it.”
James Russell Lowell, Address on Books and Libraries.
