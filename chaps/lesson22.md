Inflection of πᾶς. πᾶς has the same endings as
παύσᾱς. The genitive and dative plural of the masculine
and neuter violate the rule for accent of monosyllables of
the consonant declension (§ 102). The accent of the
feminine is regular.

Precision of Thought. “The practice of translation, by making us deliberate in the choice of the best
equivalent of a foreign word in our own language, has
likewise the advantage of continually schooling us in one
of the main elements of a good style, — precision ; and
precision of thought is not only exemplified by precision
of language, but is largely dependent on the habit of it.”
James Russell Lowell, Address on Books and Libraries.
