The verb εἰμί to be is irregular, as are the corresponding verbs in English and Latin.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="94">


All forms of the present indicative of εἰμί except
εἶ are enclitic. ἔστι when thus accented means exists or is
possible, except that it is regularly so accented after ἀλλά,
καί, μή, οὐκ, τοῦτο, ὡς and εἰ (if), whether it has this spe-
cial meaning or not.

Enclitics. (a) If the preeeding word has an ac-
cent on the ultima, the enclitic has no accent :

καλοί εἰσιν they are beautiful.

(b) If the preceding word has an acute on the antepenult or a circumflex on the penult, it receives an additional acute on the ultima and the enclitic has no accent :

ἄνθρωποί εἰσιν they are men;
στρατιῶταί εἰσιν they are soldiers.

(c) If the preceding word has an acute on the penult,
an enclitic of one syllable has no accent but an enclitic of
two syllables is accented on the final syllable:

ὁπλίτης τις a certain hoplite ;
ὁπλίτης ἐστίν he is a hoplite.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="96">


Accent of Augmented Verbs. The accent cannot
precede the augment. Therefore compound verbs are ac-
cented after the prefix :

ἐξάγω, ἐξῆγον ; ἄπ-ειμι, ἀπ-ῆν.

Contrary to Fact Conditions. εἰ with a past tense
of the indicative in the protasis and a past tense of the indicative with ἄν in the apodosis implies that the condition
is not or was not fulfilled. This is called a contrary to
fact condition. The imperfect tense indicates present time ;
the aorist indicates past time :

εἰ τὴν γέφυραν ἐφύλαττε, τας σπονδὰς ἂν ἔλυεν
if he were guarding the bridge, he would be breaking the treaty ;

εἰ... ἐφύλαξε, . .. ἂν ἔλῡσεν
if he had guarded ..., he would have broken... .



Note carefully that the presence of ἄν in the apodosis distinguishes
a contrary to fact from a past particular condition (§ 85).
