<p>The Value of Transiation. "There is no better wav
for the student to train himself in the choice of the very
word that will fit his thought than by translation from
Latin and Greek. Thus he develops habits of analysis,
habits of discriminating choice of words, habits of accurate
apprehension of the meaning which another has sought to
convey by written words, which lead to power of expression
and to power of clear thinking. Such habits are worth
more to the lawyer than all the information which a modern
school may hope to impart.” <note>Roscoe Pound, Dean of the Law School, Harvard University, as reported
in Value of the Classics, page 49.</note>

<p>The Process of Translation. From the very beginning, cultivate right habits, The time thus saved will in
the end repay you for any time that may seem to be lost
at the start.

1. Read aloud and distinctly each Greek sentence as Greek,
without conscious effort at translation.

2. Note familiar words; in unfamiliar words look for familiar
roots or suggestions as to meaning contained in the context,


<pb n="37"/>

3. Note carefully word groups and relations of words as indicated by inflectional changes.

4. Do not jump about in the sentence, but try to grasp the
thoughts as they follow in logical sequence, observing that
emphatic words are likely to occur at the beginning or end of
clauses or sentences,

5. If the meaning of any words is still unknown, consult the
vocabulary.

6. If relations of words are still obscure, reread aloud until
the entire thought is clear.

7. Translate into clear and accurate English.

The Funeral Mound at MARATHON

This is an artificial knoll, about forty feet high, erected over the bodies of
the Athenians slain at Marathon. No simpler memorial could be imagined
for the most heroic exploit in Athenian history.

<p>PRONUNCIATION OF ANGLICIZED GREEK PROPER NAMES

(a) Every educated person should know how to pronounce correctly the many Greek proper names that have
passed into English literature and English speech. Especially is this to be expected of every person who has been
privileged to study Greek.

(4) Here are a few simple rules which will help:

1. Because most Greek proper names have come into English via Latin, custom demands first that the Greek letters shall


<pb n="39"/>

be replaced by their Latin equivalents.



These can be learned from

§§ I and II, but note especially that
αι passes into  or e,
ει into î or ê,
οι into oe or ê
(when final, οι becomes î),
ου into û,
υ into y (except in diphthongs),
ος into us:

θησεῖον Theseum,
Φοῖβος Phoebus,
Φίλιπποι Philippi,
Ἐπίκουρος Epicurus,

Αἴσχυλος Aischylus,
Αἰθιοπία Ethiopia,
Ἀριστείδης Aristides,
Κύκλωψ Cyclops,

Φοῖνιξ Phoenician

2. Use the ordinary English sounds for the letters, remembering that c (for k) and g are “soft” before e or i sounds.

3. Names that have become  very common in English are likely to have lost or changed their inflectional endings:

Ἀθῆναι Athens,
Συράκουσαι Syracuse,
Ὅμηρος Homer,
Πλάτων Plato,
Ἀλέξανδρος Alexander.

Bronze Boy FROM MARATHON

This head belongs to a beautiful statue found in almost perfect condition by a fisherman in the Bay of Marathon in 1925.

4. The anglicized form is to
be accented according to the
Latin rules: two-syllabled
words accent the penult; poly-syllables accent the penult, if
long, otherwise the antepenult:
A'thens, Ody'sseus, Pene'lope.1

(c) Transliterate into English and pronounce :

Κυθέρεια
Ἀγαμέμνων
Βορέᾱς
Κῦρος
Ἡρόδοτος
Ἀφροδίτη <note>Final η, when transliterated inta é, is regularly sounded.</note>
θουκυδίδης
Ἀπόλλων
Ζεύς
Χάρων
Σωκράτης
Λυκοῦργος

(a) Words other than proper names have suffered still greater changes as to ending:

φιλοσοφία philosophy

ἄγγελος angel,
ὠκεανός ocean,


σπασμός spasm,



φιλόσοφος philosopher.
