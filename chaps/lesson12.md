## [§ 62](#para62). The Value of Translation.


"There is no better way
for students to train themselves in the choice of the very
word that will fit their thought than by translation from
Latin and Greek. Thus they develop habits of analysis,
habits of discriminating choice of words, habits of accurate
apprehension of the meaning which another has sought to
convey by written words, which lead to power of expression
and to power of clear thinking. Such habits are worth
more to the lawyer than all the information which a modern
school may hope to impart.” <note>Roscoe Pound, Dean of the Law School, Harvard University, as reported
in Value of the Classics, page 49, with pronouns updated to be gender neutral. Whatever Pound's individual thoughts, the point made still applies and applies to any student of Greek.</note>

## [§ 63](#para63). The Process of Translation.


From the very beginning, cultivate right habits, The time thus saved will in
the end repay you for any time that may seem to be lost
at the start.



1. Read aloud and distinctly each Greek sentence as Greek, without conscious effort at translation.

2. Note familiar words; in unfamiliar words look for familiar roots or suggestions as to meaning contained in the context,


<pb n="37"/>

3. Note carefully word groups and relations of words as indicated by inflectional changes.

4. Do not jump about in the sentence, but try to grasp the thoughts as they follow in logical sequence, observing that emphatic words are likely to occur at the beginning or end of clauses or sentences, 

5. If the meaning of any words is still unknown, consult the vocabulary.

6. If relations of words are still obscure, reread aloud until the entire thought is clear.

7. Translate into clear and accurate English.

# Chapter 12: The Funeral Mound at Marathon




This is an artificial knoll, about forty feet high, erected over the bodies of
the Athenians slain at Marathon. No simpler memorial could be imagined
for the most heroic exploit in Athenian history.

## [§ 66](#para66). Pronunciation of Anglicized Greek Proper Names


Here are a few simple rules which will help pronounce Greek proper names that appear in English:



1. Because most Greek proper names have come into English via Latin, we typically replace Greek letters


<pb n="39"/>
by their Latin equivalents.





These can be learned from

§§ I and II, but note especially that


- αι passes into oe or e, 
- ει into î or ê, 
- οι into oe or ê (when final, οι becomes î), 
- ου into û, 
- υ into y (except in diphthongs), 
- ος into us:





- θησεῖον Theseum, 
- Φοῖβος Phoebus,
- Φίλιπποι Philippi, 
- Ἐπίκουρος Epicurus,

- Αἴσχυλος Aischylus, 
- Αἰθιοπία Ethiopia, 
- Ἀριστείδης Aristides,
- Κύκλωψ Cyclops,

- Φοῖνιξ Phoenician



2. Use the ordinary English sounds for the letters, remembering that c (for k) and g are “soft” before e or i sounds.



3. Names that have become  very common in English are likely to have lost or changed their inflectional endings:

- Ἀθῆναι Athens,  
- Συράκουσαι Syracuse, 
- Ὅμηρος Homer, 
- Πλάτων Plato, 
- Ἀλέξανδρος Alexander.







4. The anglicized form is to
be accented according to the
Latin rules: two-syllabled
words accent the penult; poly-syllables accent the penult, if
long, otherwise the antepenult:
A'thens, Ody'sseus, Pene'lope.1



(c) Transliterate into English and pronounce :

- Κυθέρεια 
- Ἀγαμέμνων 
- Βορέᾱς 
- Κῦρος
- Ἡρόδοτος 
- Ἀφροδίτη <note>Final η, when transliterated inta é, is regularly sounded.</note>
- θουκυδίδης 
- Ἀπόλλων
- Ζεύς 
- Χάρων 
- Σωκράτης 
- Λυκοῦργος

(a) Words other than proper names have suffered still greater changes as to ending:

- φιλοσοφία philosophy

- ἄγγελος angel, 
- ὠκεανός ocean,


- σπασμός spasm,

- φιλόσοφος philosopher.
