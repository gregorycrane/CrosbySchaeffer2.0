The Consonant Declension includes nouns whose
stems end in a consonant.

The stem appears when the ending -ος is dropped from
the genitive singular. To this stem the endings for the
other cases are added.

The ending for the nominative singular should be learned
from the vocabulary. Sometimes it ends in -s. The dative
plural ends in -σι. The σ in each of these instances unites
with κ, γ, or χ to form ξ.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="102">


Monosyllables of the consonant declension are
accented on the ultima in the genitive and dative of all
numbers, the circumflex occurring on long vowels or diph-
thongs, otherwise the acute.

Inflect @paé. Compare with paradigm (§ 509, a).

THE PHALANX

By means of the phalanx, invented and developed by
Greeks, Alexander the Great imposed his will upon most
of the civilized world. In the hands of the Romans, who
were quick to grasp its possibilities, it grew into the famous
legion.


“The average depth of the phalanx was eight men,
although it occasionally reached sixteen, even before the
time of the Macedonians. Epaminondas made his left
wing about fifty ranks deep. The spear might be twenty-one feet long, or even twenty-four in Hellenistic times.
Five or six rows of spear points would project beyond the
front rank making an impenetrable barrier. The spears
of the rear ranks rested upon the shoulders of men in front
with their points directed upward. The formation looked
like a huge porcupine with the quills pointing in one
direction. The Roman consul, Lucius Aemilius, a seasoned
veteran, confessed to friends at Rome that he had never
seen anything more terrible and alarming than the Macedonian phalanx of Perseus.”
