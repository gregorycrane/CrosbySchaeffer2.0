>> [Xenophon, *Anabasis*, 4.7.24. ](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc2:4.7.24?right=perseus-eng2)




## [§ 81](#para81). Feminines in -ᾰ.


Most nouns of the a-declension
have -ᾱ or -η in the nominative and carry the same throughout the singular. A few nouns have -ᾰ in the nominative.
These have ᾱ in the genitive and dative singular, if the
preceding letter is ι or ρ; otherwise they have η.



ἅμαξα, ἁμάξης, ἡ, wagon


| sing. | plural | 
| --- | --- 
| ἅμαξα (note 2) | ἅμαξαι |

note 2 For accent, see § V, e, f, g.


Note that in the singular, nominative and accusative agree as to
final vowel, quantity of final vowel, and accent; and that the genitive
and dative show the same agreement.



In like manner inflect θάλαττα and βασίλεια.

The Personal Pronouns are <rs type="lemma">ἐγώ</rs>,
<rs type="lemma">σύ</rs> you (sg.), for
the first and second persons. For the third person, αὐτός
is used in all cases except the nominative.



ἐγώ, I

| sing | plural | 
| --- | --- 
| ἐγώ | ἡμεῖς | 
| ἐμοῦ, μου (note 3) | ἡμῶν | 
| ἐμοί, μοι | ἡμῖν | 
| ἐμέ, με | ἡμᾶς | 




σύ, you

| --- | --- 
| σύ | ὑμεῖς | 
| σοῦ, σου (note 3) | ὑμῶν | 
| σοί, σοι | ὑμῖν | 
| σέ, σε | ὑμᾶς | 




3 The unaccented forms are enclitic (§ V,j). When used, they show that
no emphasis is intended. The accented forms are emphatic or are used with
prepositions. The nominative is not used except when emphasis is desired.

## [§ 83](#para83). Particular Conditions.


(a) εἰ with a present or past
tense of the indicative in the protasis1 and the same tense
of the indicative or its equivalent in the apodosis1 states a
particular condition without implying anything as to its
fulfillment or non-fulfillment. This is called a particular
condition in present or past time:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  εἰ τὴν γέφυραν φυλάττει, τὰς σπονδὰς λύει   |  if he is guarding the bridge, he is breaking the treaty ;  |



| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  εἰ ... ἐφύλαξε, ... ἔλυσε  |  if he guarded ..., he broke....  |






(b) The regular negative of the protasis is μή, of the
apodosis οὐ.



1 The terms “protasis” and "apodosis" denote respectively the “if clause” and the "conclusion ” of conditional sentences.



2 Proclitic οὐ takes an accent at the end of a sentence, because no word follows with which it may be pronounced.

# Chapter 15: Figure: THE SEA GOD’S SHRINΕ


These columns of whitest marble, belonging to the temple of Poseidon, still welcome the
seafarer to Attica as in the proud
days of Pericles.

Menander, the Athenian
comic poet, by reason of his thorough acquaintance with
human nature and his consummate literary art, has been
almost as often quoted in later ages as Shakespeare. Even
St. Paul (1 Corinthians, XV. 33) repeats one of his lines:

φθείρουσιν ἤθη χρηστὰ ὁμῑλίαι κακαί
evil communications corrupt good manners.
