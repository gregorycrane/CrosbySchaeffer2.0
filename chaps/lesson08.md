## [§ 41](#para41). The Imperfect Tense.


This tense denotes action
continued, repeated, customary, or attempted in past time:

ἔπαυον I was stopping, I kept stopping, I used to stop, I tried to stop.

IMPERFECT INDICATIVE ACTIVE

παύω I stop ἄγω lead

## [§ 42](#para42). Formation.


The imperfect tense is built on the
present stem showing the variable vowel (ο or ε). Being
a secondary3 tense, it differs from the present in having
(1) augment, (2) secondary endings. It is found only
in the indicative.

## [§ 43](#para43). Augment.


All secondary tenses of the indicative
may be recognized by what is called augment. This is of
two kinds:

1. Syllabic. Verbs with an initial consonant prefix ἐ
by way of augment; an initial ῥ is doubled after ἐ.

<pb n="23"/>

2. Temporal.

Verbs with an initial vowel or diphthong lengthen the initial vowel.


α - η
ε - η
ο - ω
ι - ῑ
υ - ῡ
αι  - ῃ
αυ  - ηυ
οι  - ῳ

## [§ 44](#para44). Dative of Manner.


The dative may denote manner :2

φεύγουσι σιγῇ they flee in silence.

## [§ 45](#para45). Balanced Structure.


μέν ... δέ are used with
two words or phrases or
clauses that are compared
or contrasted:

ὁ (ἡ, τὸ) μέν . . ὁ (ἡ, τὸ) δέ the one . . . the other;

οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) μέν. .. οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) δέ some . . . others;
ὁ δέ, ἡ δέ, κ.τ.λ. but (and) he, she, etc.,
indicating change of subject. μέν is rarely to be translated but is a valuable warning that a comparison or contrast is coming. It is one of the many little words, often untranslatable, that make Greek so effective for expressing important shades of meaning.

# Chapter 8: Figure: An Ionic Column



The delicate workmanship of the
Erechtheum, to which this column
belongs, awakens universal admiration.

1 Certain verbs beginning with ε change ε to ει when augmented : ἔχω, εἶχον.

2 This is our fifth use of the dative. What were the other four?
3. κ.τ.λ. = καὶ τὰ λοιπά and the rest. Compare etc. = et cetera.

## [§ 48](#para48). Greek as a World Language.


(a) The international language of the first century of our era was Greek. To carry its message to the world, therefore, the New Testament was written in Greek. The following passage is from St. Luke,
6. 45:


ὁ μὲν ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐκ
τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ (treasure) τῆς καρδίας (compare
CARDIAC) προφέρει (brings
forth) τὸ ἀγαθόν,1 ὁ δὲ πονη-
ρὸς 1 (evil) ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ 1 τὸ
πονηρον.1

(b) Word-formation. The Christian religion not only was transmitted through Greek. Its theology was shaped by Greek philosophy and its language and thought by Greek words.

Hundreds of ecclesiastical terms now in use came from Greek : Christ, Bible, Episcopalian, anthem, hierarchy, cathedral, liturgy, Pentatench, atheist, apostate, martyr, menphiyte, hypocrite, laity, CANON.
and the like,

How many similar derivatives can you supply from the Greek words that you have already had ?

Try these:

λόγος (combine with φίλος, and δέκα), ἀπό, ἐξ (combine with ὁδός road), παρά, ἄγγελος, διά.
