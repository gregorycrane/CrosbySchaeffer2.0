# Chapter 8: Imperfect Indicative Active of ω-verbs


> ἔργον δ᾽ οὐδὲν ὄνειδος, ἀεργίη δέ τ᾽ ὄνειδος.

<quote>Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace.

>> [Hesiod, Works and Days, 311](https://scaife-dev.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg002.perseus-grc2:311?right=perseus-eng2).



## [§ 41](#para41). The Imperfect Tense.


This tense denotes action
continued, repeated, customary, or attempted in past time:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἔπαυον  |  I was stopping, I kept stopping, I used to stop, I tried to stop.  |




IMPERFECT INDICATIVE ACTIVE


*παύω* *I stop *
*ἄγω* *I lead*


| pers num | παύω | ἄγω | 
| --- | --- | --- 
| 1st sg | ἔπαυον | ἦγον | 
| 2nd sg | ἔπαυες | ἦγες | 
| 3rd sg | ἔπαυε | ἦγε | 
| 1st pl | ἐπαύομεν | ἤγομεν | 
| 2nd pl | ἐπαύετε | ἤγετε | 
| 3rd pl | ἔπαυον | ἦγον | 




## [§ 42](#para42). Formation.


The imperfect tense is built on the
present stem showing the variable vowel (ο or ε). Being
a secondary3 tense, it differs from the present in having
(1) augment, (2) secondary endings. It is found only
in the indicative.

## [§ 43](#para43). Augment.


All secondary tenses of the indicative
may be recognized by what is called augment. This is of
two kinds:



1. Syllabic. Verbs with an initial consonant prefix ἐ
by way of augment; an initial ῥ is doubled after ἐ.

<pb n="23"/>



2. Temporal.

Verbs with an initial vowel or diphthong lengthen the initial vowel.


| base | augmented | 
| --- | --- 
| α | η | 
| ε | η | 
| ο | ω | 
| ι | ῑ | 
| υ | ῡ | 
| αι | ῃ | 
| αυ | ηυ | 
| οι | ῳ | 





Inflect the imperfect indicative active of <rs type="lemma">πέμπω</rs> and ἀθροίζω.

## [§ 44](#para44). Dative of Manner.


The dative may denote manner

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  φεύγουσι σιγῇ  |  they flee in silence.  |



This is our fifth use of the dative. What are the other four?


## [§ 45](#para45). Balanced Structure.


μέν ... δέ are used with
two words or phrases or
clauses that are compared
or contrasted:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ (ἡ, τὸ) μέν . . ὁ (ἡ, τὸ) δέ  |   the one . . . the other;  |
|  οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) μέν. .. οἱ (αἱ, τὰ) δέ  |  some . . . others;  |
|  ὁ δέ, ἡ δέ, κ.τ.λ.  |  but (and) he, she, etc.,  |


indicating change of subject.


Translators often do not translate μέν but many students of Greek find it helpful to represent it as "on the one hand" or a similar phrase indicating a contrast or comparison is coming. It is one of the many little words, often difficult to translate into English, that make Greek so effective for expressing important shades of meaning.


## [§ 44](#para44). Dative of Manner.

## [§ 47](#para47). Exercises.




(a) What do the portions in heavy type tell as to person
and number of the subject?

1. ἦγ-**ον**
2. ἔλῡ-**ε**
3. ἐγράφ-**ομεν **
4. ἤθροιζ-**ες**
5. ἠθέλ-**ετε**

Which personal endings of the imperfect are identical?
Vhich resemble endings of the present ?

(b) Translate :

1. ἠθροιζες λίθους παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν;
2. ἀλλ᾽ ἐπέμπομεν τὴν φυλακὴν παρὰ τὸν ἀδελφόν.
3. ἡ στρατιὰ ἦν ἐν τῇ κώμῃ καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἥρπαζεν.
4. οἱ μὲν γὰρ κραυγῇ ἐκ τῆς ἀγορᾶς ἔφευγον. οἱ δὲ σιγῇ τὰς σκηνὰς ἐφύλαττον.
5. οἱ δὲ ἀρχαῖοι εἶχον* κώμας μικράς.
6. καλὰ μὲν ἦν τὰ δῶρα, μικρὰ δέ.
7. τὰ μὲν ἔργα τὰ τοῦ βαρβάρου ἦν καλά, οἱ δὲ λόγοι φίλιοι.

* In the verb ἔχω, the augment is not η but ει. Thus we get, εἶχον, *I was holding, I was possessing, I used to have.* The verb stem ἐχ-/σχ- derives from *σ(ε)χ- and we get the impf. εἶχον  from *ἔεχον (Cambridge Grammar of Classical Greek 11.40). This is the only verb we have encountered so far that has this irregular augment.





(c) Complete :

1. ἠγ-- (2d plural) τὸν ἔπτπ--- ἐκ τ--- πεδι --- (singular).
2. καὶ τὸ ἐργ- δηλ-- ἦν τ--- πολεμι--.
3. ὁ δὲ κραυγ--- ἐφευγ -- εἰς τ-- κωμ---- (singular).

(d) Write in Greek:

1. The army was friendly to the country.
2. They guard the provisions for ten days.
3. On account of the treaty we do not wish to destroy the village.
4. The garrison flees ten stades.?

## [§ 48](#para48). Greek as a World Language.


(a) The international language of the first century of our era was Greek. To carry its message to the world, therefore, the New Testament was written in Greek. The following passage is from the Gospel attributed to Luke:

<quote>ὁ μὲν ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐκ
τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ (treasure) τῆς καρδίας (compare
CARDIAC) προφέρει (brings
forth) τὸ ἀγαθόν,1 ὁ δὲ πονηρὸς 1 (evil) ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ 1 τὸ
πονηρον.1
>> [Luke 6.45](https://scaife-dev.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0031.tlg003.perseus-grc2:6.45?right=perseus-eng2)





* Recall the note about adjectives as substantives at <ref n="38">38</ref> above.




(b) Word-formation. The Christian religion not only was transmitted through Greek. Its theology was shaped by Greek philosophy and its language and thought by Greek words.



Hundreds of ecclesiastical terms now in use came from Greek : Christ, Bible, Episcopalian, anthem, hierarchy, cathedral, liturgy, Pentatench, atheist, apostate, martyr, neophyte, hypocrite, laity, CANON.
and the like,



How many similar derivatives can you supply from the Greek words that you have already had ?



GRC: In the nineteenth century American professors of Greek and Latin were often trained in Germany and they followed the German tradition of separating Classical Greek and Latin from Christian Greek and Latin. Students of Classical Greek at an institution such as Harvard would commonly have no experience with the New Testament Greek program in the Divinity School. This textbook, however, makes a consistent effort to integrate the New Testament and Christian Greek, thus reflecting the much different culture of secondary schools in the early 20th century (at least secondary schools that taught Greek).



See if you can identify other English cognates using these terms:

λόγος (combine with φίλος, and δέκα), ἀπό, ἐξ (combine with ὁδός road), παρά, ἄγγελος, διά.
