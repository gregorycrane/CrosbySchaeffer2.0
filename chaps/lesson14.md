# Chapter 14: DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS


<quote xml:lang="grc">
σπεῦδε βραδέως.


<quote xml:lang="eng">
Make haste slowly.


>> Suetonius, Augustus, 25. A favorite expression of Augustus.



<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="74">


The principal demonstrative pronouns are οὗτος this
(Latin hic), ὅδε this, and ἐκεῖνος that (Latin <foreign xml:lang="lat">ille</foreign>).

οὗτος this
ὅδε this


Note that οὗτος has the same endings as αὐτός (§ 68), that it has
initial τ- only where the article ὁ, ἡ, τό has τ-, and that it has ου in
the penult only when an ο-sound occurs in the ultima, having αυ in
the other forms.

Contrast οὗτος and αὐτός as to breathing, accent, and stem.

Note that the forms of ὅδε are the forms of the article with -δέ
added.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="75">


ἐκεῖνος has the same endings and accents as οῧτος,
Inflect it, and compare with paradigm (§ 523).

## [§ 76](#para76). Uses of the Demonstratives.


(a) οὗτος and ὅδε both
mean this, this book, ete.; but οὗτος usually refers to something already mentioned, and ὅδε to something yet to
follow:

ταῦτα ἔγραψε
this (just mentioned) is what he wrote ;
ἔγραψε τάδε
he wrote as follows.

(b) ἐκεῖνος refers to something more remote than do
οὗτος and ὅδε and is translated *that*.
(c) All three may be used as emphatic personal pronouns,
he, she, it, they.
(d) When used as demonstrative adjectives all three
have the predicate position (§ 31, 2):
αὕτη ἡ κώμη this village ;
ἐκείνη ἡ κώμη that village.

## [§ 77](#para77). Dative of Means.


The dative indicates the means whereby an act is done: [note: The dative has three distinct divisions as to use, corresponding to English phrases with to or for, with, and in.]
τὸν ποταμὸν διαβαίνει πλοίῳ
he crosses the river in (by means of) a boat.

## [§ 80](#para80). Dean Inge, of St.


Paul’s Cathedral, London, writes:
“The Christian Church was the last great creative achievement of classical culture.”[note: Legacy of Greece, page 30.
] The λόγος of St. John’s
Gospel is one of many evidences of this.


<quote>ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς [note: in the presence of] ὃ τὸν θεόν
(compare THEOLOGY), καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος. οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν.
>> St. John, 1. 1-2.
