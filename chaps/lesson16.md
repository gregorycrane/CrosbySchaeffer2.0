# Chapter 16: MASCULINE NOUNS OF THE A-DECLENSION. REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS

>  ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σαυτόν.<br/>
>  You will love your neighbor as yourself<br/>
>> St. Matthew, XIX. 19.




## [§ 87](#para87). Masculine Nouns of the α-declension.


Most nouns
of the α-declension are feminine. Masculines may be
recognized not merely as referring to males but also as showing -ης or -ας instead of -η or -α in the nominative singular.
Their genitive singular ends in -ου. Otherwise the inflection parallels that of the feminines.

Note the two indications of masculine gender in -ς of the nominative singular and -ου of the genitive singular, both of which occur in the ο-declension.

In like manner inflect ὁπλίτης.

Reflexive Pronouns are formed from the stems of the
personal pronouns and the proper case forms of αὐτός. In
the plural of the first and second persons both parts of the
word are fully inflected. The pronoun of the third person,
however, has the compounded form in the plural.


| masc. | fem. | 
| --- | --- 
| ἐμαυτοῦ | ἐμαυτῆς | 
| ἐμαυτῷ | ἐμαυτῇ | 
| ἐμαυτόν | ἐμαυτήν | 
| ἡμῶν αὐτῶν | ἡμῶν αὐτῶν | 
| ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς | ἡμῖν αὐταῖς | 
| ἡμᾶς αὐτούς | ἡμᾶς αὐτάς | 



| masc. | fem. | 
| --- | --- 
| σεαυτοῦ | σεαυτῆς | 
| σεαυτῷ | σεαυτῇ | 
| σεαυτόν | σεαυτήν | 
| ὑμῶν αὐτῶν | ὑμῶν αὐτῶν | 
| ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς | ὑμῖν αὐταῖς | 
| ὑμᾶς αὐτούς | ὑμᾶς αὐτάς | 



| masc. | fem. | 
| --- | --- 
| ἑαυτοῦ | ἑαυτῆς | 
| ἑαυτῷ | ἑαυτῇ | 
| ἑαυτόν | ἑαυτήν | 
| ἑαυτῶν | ἑαυτῶν | 
| ἑαυτοῖς | ἑαυταῖς | 
| ἑαυτούς | ἑαυτάς | 




Contracted forms σαυτοῦ and αὑτοῦ are often used in place of σεαυτοῦ and ἑαυτοῦ.


For obvious reasons the reflexive pronouns of the first and second persons have no neuter.

Reflexive Pronouns appear in the predicate and refer
to the subject of the sentence or clause in which they stand.
As such they are direct refleaives. Sometimes they appear
in a dependent clause and refer to the subject of the main
clause. They then are indirect reflexives:

ἧκον ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ σκηνὴν
I went to my own tent;

ἔπεισαν ἐμὲ ἥκειν ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτῶν σκηνήν
they persuaded me to go to their (own) tent.
