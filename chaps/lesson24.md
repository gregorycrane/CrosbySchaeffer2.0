Passive Voice. Like English and Latin, Greek
has a passive voice, which shows the subject as acted
upon:

παύομαι. I am being stopped.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="134">
Middle Voice. Greek also has a middle voice,
which shows that the subject so acts as somehow to affect
himself.

(a) The subject may act on himself:

παύομαι I am stopping myself, I am stopping (intransitive).

(6) The subject may act on or with something that be-
longs to him, ov in such a way as to benefit, injure, or other-
wise affect himself or his interests +

παρέχομαι I supply for myself;
λύομαι τοὺς ἵππους I loose my (own) horses. <note>GRC: If memory serves, there is a nice alternation of luw/luomai with Circe or Calypso and Od</note>

There is no difference in appearance between the
middle and the passive in the present and imperfect. As
in the active voice, the vowel ο appears before μ or ν of
the ending, while ε appears before other endings. The ε
of the second person singular drops out between two
vowels, which are then contracted.

The present and imperfect middle and passive have the
same stem as the present active.

Deponent Verbs. Some verbs have forms only in
the middle or passive voice but with active meanings.
They are called deponents :

ἕπομαι I follow.

Inflect the present and imperfect indicative, and give
the present infinitive and participle of wopevopac,

Genitive of Agent. ὑπό and the genitive when
modifying a passive verb indicate the agent or doer of an
action (compare with the Latin a or ab and the ablative): 1

ἀθροίζεται ὑπὸ αὐτοῦ it ts being gathered by him.
