# Chapter 1: Declension ο-stem Nouns



>  ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος.<br/>
>  In the beginning was the word.<br/>
>> John, 1.1







## [§ 1](#para1). Declensions.


Greek uses word endings (and to a lesser degree prefixes) far more than languages such as English or Mandarin. English still uses some endings -- English speakers recogngize that "endings" is plural and "ending" is singular. Likewise, English speakers know that the added -s with verbs indicates a singular subject: "she travel*s*" vs. "they travel." Greek has three basic classes of endings for nouns. We will talk about the meanings that these endings convey below. This section introduces the forms.

We will talk about the meanings that these endings convey below. This section introduces the forms.



While there are many (!) small variations, all Greek nouns roughly follow the following three patterns. Each pattern for noun formation is traditionally called a "declension." Core examples of the three declensions of Greek include the following:



<foreign>ἀρετή, ἀρετῆς, ἡ</foreign>, *excellence, skill*


<foreign>ποταμός, ποταμοῦ, ὁ</foreign>, *river, stream*


<foreign>φύλαξ, φύλακος, ὁ</foreign>, *guardian*


The entries above provide the nominative singular and the genitive -- if we know those two forms, we can generate all the forms for any (regular) noun.


We then add the article to show the gender of the noun. The article ἡ (as we will formally learn later) is the feminine. The article ὁ is masculine. We will also learn the neuter article τό when we encounter neuter nouns in lesson 4.

| | 1st Declension/α-stem | 2nd Declension/ο-stem | 3rd Declension/C-stem | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| Nom. | ἀρετή | ποταμός | φύλαξ (φύλακ-ς) | 
| Gen. | ἀρετῆς | ποταμοῦ | φύλακ-ος | 
| Dat. | ἀρετῇ | ποταμῷ | φύλακ-ι | 
| Acc. | ἀρετήν | ποταμόν | φύλακ-α (φύλακ-ν) | 
| Tokens | 2662 | 3352 | 3359 | 
| Lemmas | 465 | 473 | 412 | 

Crosby and Schaeffer avoid the terms "first/second/third declension" because they chose to start with nouns that have a stem that ends in -ο (omicron, "little o"). They begin with the "second declension" because of "their general uniformity," i.e., because there are fewer small variant ways to generate o-stem nouns. (Second declension nouns use two different endings for nominative and accusative: -ον for the singular, -α for the plural.) Furthermore, o-stem endings are reused for pronouns, adjectives and participles. Once you are familiar with the o-stem endings, you can also understand the case endings on an additional c. 6,981 additional words -- in other words, you will be able to understand the case endings for 10,332 of the tokens (18%) in the *Anabasis*.



> **Note**: The caveat reflects the fact that the genitive plural ending is common to all three declensions. While automatic count simply assumes that o-stem nouns account for 1/3 of the ambiguous forms, that ambiguity should not significantly affect the overall total.






In the table shows that the frequency of all three classes of noun is comparable in the *Anabasis*. To understand that, we need to explain two terms: **word tokens**  and **lemmata**. To understand the difference, consider the following sentence:



>  The term tokens describes the number of words in a text.<br/>

If we count each word in this  sentence, we will find that there are 11 tokens. Our digital editoin of Xenophon's *Anabasis* contains 57,245 tokens, i.e, running words of text. The table above shows that, of these 57,245 tokens, 2,662 (4.65%) are α-stem nouns, 3,352 (5.85%) are ο-stem nouns, and 3,357 (5.87%) are consonantal stem nouns.


The term **lemmas**  describes the normalized dictionary form for a word. In the table above, you can see that ποταμός, ποταμοῦ, ποταμῷ, ποταμόν etc. are all forms of the same word. When we look up a noun in a standard Greek dictionary, we look up that first form in the table (the nominative singular). By dividing tokens by lemmas, we can see that each a-stem, o-stem and K-stem lemmas shows up c. 5, 7 and 8 times in the *Anabasis*, i.e., if you learn a vocab word,  you are likely to see it 4, 6 and 7 times again.

O-stem nouns are more frequent than a-stem nouns and roughly as frequent as K-stem nouns. Equally important, o-stem nouns are very simple -- once you have learned the declension in this chapter, you will have only a few variations (for the neuter gender) to learn.

## [§ 2](#para2). Ο-Stem Masculines.


Nouns of the ο-declension
whose nominatives end in -ος are usually masculine.



*ποταμός, ποταμοῦ, ὁ — a river*


| | Singular |  | Plural |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
| Nominative | ὁ ποταμός | the river (subject) | οἱ ποταμοί | the rivers (subject) | 
| Genitive | τοῦ ποταμοῦ | of the river | τῶν ποταμῶν | of the rivers | 
| Dative | τῷ ποταμῷ | to/for the river | τοῖς ποταμοῖς | to/for the rivers | 
| Accusative | τὸν ποταμόν | the river (object) | τοὺς ποταμούς | the rivers (object) | 







In like manner inflect ὁ ἀδελφός.



The table above is often called a paradigm, an English word derived from the Greek "paradeigma," "something that you show (deigma) on the side (para)." As noted above, the table from the text book shows the most important forms. If we look at the paradigm illustrating the forms of <foreign>ποταμός</foreign> *river* that actually appear in the 20 million word Glaux Trees parsed corpus of Ancient Greek, we can see that there are additional forms that the textbook leaves out but we can also see that the textbook has nicely captured the most important forms.

1. The same ending appears with both acute (ποταμός) and grave (ποταμὸς) accents. The shift from acute to grave (discussed below) happens when another accented word follows. You can see that, in the corpus, the grave accent is used 697 times and that the acute accent (which the textbook shows you) only appears 271 out of 968 times (27%). A word like ποταμός usually has another accented word following it and appears as ποταμὸς. 
- You can see that Greek does have instances where we get forms in thedual ("two rivers"), but there are only 3 instances of the dual number.
- The textbook leaves out one Greek case: the vocative. The vocative is used when a speaker directly addresses someone. The vocative form ποταμὲ means "O River!" but it only occurs 1 time in 20 million tokens. While this low number reflects the fact that people do not typically address an anonymous river, vocative forms are not very common -- and they are easy (in o-stem nows, just shorten the -ος ending to -ε).









## [§ 2a](#para2a). Number and Verbs.



Ancient Greek has endings not only for the singular (e.g., English river vs. rivers) but also has a dual number used to describe pairs (e.g., two hands, two siblings etc.). Because the dual is much less common, many introductory grammars leave it out so that learners can focus on higher frequency features. We will see duals when we look at real primary sources but the digital part of speech annotations will (usually) identify these. You will learn to recognize them as you read more Greek.



While this lesson focuses on introducing nouns, it also introduces  singular and plural forms for three different verbs. These forms allow us to begin generating full sentence and thus to see when we apply each case to a noun.


| Lemma | Short Def | Singular | Plural | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| εἰμί | to be | ἦν, s/he or it was | ἦσαν, they were | 
| ἔχω | to have, to possess | ἔχει s/he or it has | ἔχουσι, they have | 
| παύω | to stop | παύει s/he or it stops | παύουσι, they stop | 
| πέμπω | to send | πέμπει, s/he or it sends | πέμπουσι, they send | 
| w-stem verbs ending n  |  | -ει 256 | -ουσι 132 | 


Following the patterns above, you could explain and/or generate 256 third person singular forms (s/he or it) and 132 third person plural (they) forms that occur in the Anabasis: e.g.,



ἀναβαίνω, *to go up, mount, to go up to*.

>  **ἀναβαίνει** ... ὁ Κῦρος<br/>
>  Cyrus goes up.<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 1.1.2 



ἀγγέλλω, *to bear a message*

>  οἱ αἱρετοὶ **ἀγγέλλουσι** τοῖς στρατιώταις<br/>
>  The ones who had been selected bear a message to the soldiers.<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 1.3.21 







## [§ 3](#para3). Accents.


(a) In nouns of the ο-declension an acute (´) on the ultima in the nominative becomes a
circumflex (῀) in the genitive and dative of both numbers.


The acute accent can only occur on (1) the last or the second to last syllable and only on a long syllable.





<pb n="2"/>




(b) An acute on the ultima changes to a grave (`) when a word follows without intervening punctuation:



<foreign xml:id="p3.1">ἀδελφὸν ἔχει</foreign>: <gloss target="p3.1">s/he has a brother.</gloss>



(c) If the accent on the nominative of an o-stem noun is an acute, the accent is an acute also in the accusative. This makes sense given the statement above, for the accusative singular because that ending is short and cannot bear a circumflex accent. If you remember that a circumflex involves a rising and then a declining tone, it makes sense: the short syllable is not long enough for the up and down tones -- that requires more length. 


That said, the accusative plural ending, -ους, is long but it still does not bear a circumflex. The reason is probably that the ending -ους comes from *-ονς and was thus originally short.


The bottom line is that an accented long final syllable can take a circumflex but it does not have to. You just have to remember those places where the long final syllable takes an acute.



## [§ 4](#para4). Cases.


The different endings give you information about how a noun is used in a sentence. English retains traces of such a system in its pronouns. Thus we can say:

>  She saw him.<br/>

But a statement such as the following is simply not grammatical:

>  *Him saw she.<br/>

We can, however, within limits violate standard word order for emphasis. Thus, the following sentence is grammatical and emphatic:

>  Him she saw!<br/>

Because Greek words have different endings that help you understand the role of a word, Greek word order is more flexible that than of English (or of other languages with little or not inflection, such as French, Mandarin, and Spanish). Thus the Star Wars character Yoda would sound quite idiomatic if translated directly into Ancient Greek -- thus losing some of his charm.

(a) A noun appears in the nominative when that noun is the subject of a verb or when the noun is the predicate of a verb.



| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἦσαν ἀδελφοί  |  the generals were brothers.  |

"The generals" are the subject of the verb "were" and they are in the nominative. The subject of a typical verb will always be in the nominative. (We will see an exception involving more complicated sentences later but for now subjects are always in the nominative.)



The example above, however, illustrates a second usage of the nominative. We learn that the generals are also brothers. There is no action involved. We simply learn that A is equivalent to B. We say, in this case, that "brothers" is the **predicate** of "the generals." The technical term predicate is derived from the Latin word praedico, "to proclaim, to state publicly." Thus the predicate is simply something proclaimed or stated about the subject. Because the verb does not involve an action that changes "brothers," "brothers" remains in the nominative.


(b) The genitive suggests a relationship like that expressed

with "of" in English.

It frequently denotes possession :
| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ ἀδελφός:  |  the brother of the general; literally: the of-the-general brother  |

Note that the Greek can use the article to make the relationship unambiguous. Compare a famously ambigous English sentence:

>  I saw the person in the park with a telescope.<br/>

Was I using a telescope to see that person? Was that person in the park that has a telescope? Or was the person using the telescope? Any of these interpretations is possible.



In Greek we could say:
>  I saw the with-the-telescope person in the park.<br/>
or
>  I saw the person in the with-the-telescope park.<br/>




(c) The dative suggests relations like those with "to" or
"for" in English. "Dative" is derived from the Latin "dare", *to give* and the classic use of the dative is in a sentence like "he gives a gift to his brother." The dative frequently denotes the indirect object :

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  τῷ στρατηγῷ πέμπει τὸν ἀδελφόν:  |  s/he sends his brother to the general.  |

We could also say:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  τῷ ποταμῷ πέμπει στρατηγόν:  |  s/he sends a general for the river.  |

We could also translate the above as "he sends a general of the river." The point is that the general is dispatched to/for the river, i.e., to be in charge of the river.





(d) The accusative is the direct object of a transitive
verb. (And, converseley a transitive verb is any verb that can take a direct object in the accusative!)

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἀδελφὸν πέμπει  |  he sends a brother.  |





(e) The vocative case is used when addressing someone. The textbook does not introduce this case becauxe it is not very common and because it is easy to generate the form. The vocative is often the same as the nominative. In some case, as with o-stems, the vocative is shorted form of the nominative.



We will learn later in this lesson:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ στρατηγός  |  the general  |

From this we could create the voative:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὦ στρατηγέ  |  oh general!  |




This chapter introduces core functions of the most common four Greek cases. Indo-European, the language (or cluster of languages) from which Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Irish and many other languages derive, had three other cases -- a total of eight.

1. The **instrumental**: "I hammered the nail **by means of a hammer.** In Greek, this function is, as we will see below, taken over by the dative.
2. The **ablative** (from Latin ab-latus, "taken/carried away"): "I went **away from the lake**. In Greek, this function is, as we will see below, taken over the genitive.
3. The **locative**: "at home," "in the ocean." In Greek, this function is, as we will see below, taken over by the dative.

Other Indo-European languages preserve some of these cases: Ukrainian and Croatian both have the locative and instrumental case, while Latin contained both a dative and an ablative case.




## [§ 5](#para5). The Article.



(a) Greek does not use an indefinite article in the same way as English. When Greek designates "a river" or "a general" or "a brother," it just uses a form of ποταμός, στρατηγός, or ἀδελφός in the appropriate case.

Greek does have a definite article, i.e., a word that (roughly) corresponds to "the" in English.

<rs type="lemma">ὁ</rs> Like English, and unlike Latin,
Greek has a definite article. This agrees with its noun
in gender, number, and case. It often serves as a possessive pronoun, as my, your, his, etc. ὁ and οἱ are proclitic
(page xxvii).

(b) Greek has no indefinite article. Many Greek nouns having no definite article require the addition of "a" or "an" when translated into English:

## [§ 6](#para6). Vocabulary.






The definite article accompanies nouns in vocabularies to show gender. 


In the vocabularies derivatives and cognates are printed in small capitals.


In the vocabulary we calculate how often each word appears in Xenophon's Anabasis and then we give you the running total -- how many words in Xenopon you can understand after adding a new word to what you have studied already.  


Because we have not yet studied Greek verbs, this lesson gives us six isolated verb forms so that we can start to generate sentences. Four of thses verb forms show up fairly often. Two of them, however, - "s/he stops" and "they stop" -- do not appear ever in the Anabasis. The verb "to stop" does appear but not very oten in the active voice and never in the forms <foreign>παύει</foreign> and <foreign>παύουσι</foreign>. Textbooks use verbs like <foreign>παύει</foreign>, "I stop," because these verbs are morphologically easy to generate. 
| Lemma | Freq | Total | Gloss |
| --- | --- | --- | -- |
| ἀδελφός | 20 | 20 | ἀδελφοῦ, ὁ: brother.  PHILADELPHIA.
| ἔχει | 16 | 36 | he, she, or it has,
| ἔχουσι | 1 | 37 | they have.
| ἦν | 280 | 317 | he, she, it was;  there was.
| ἦσαν | 132 | 449 | they or there were.
| ὁ | 6522 | 6971 | ἡ, τό: the.
| παύει | 0 | 6971 | he, she, or it stops (transitive).
| παύουσι | 0 | 6971 | they stop (transitive).
| πέμπει | 9 | 6980 | he, she, or it sends (transitive).
| πέμπουσι | 7 | 6987 | they send (transitive).
| ποταμός | 99 | 7086 | ποταμοῦ, ὁ: river, HIPPOPOTAMUS.
| στρατηγός | 151 | 7237 | στρατηγοῦ, ὁ: general. STRATEGY.







## [§ 6a](#para6a). Examples from Xenophon.


Predicate nominatives:


>  τὸ δὲ σύμπαν **δῆλος** **ἦν** **Κῦρος**  ὡς σπεύδων πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδὸν.<br/>

>  On the whole, **Cyrus** **was** **obvious**, insofar as he was rushing through the whole trip.<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 1.5.9



We find the expression "general of the Greeks" multiple times:


>  ἐπειδὴ δὲ πάντας παρήλασε , στήσας τὸ ἅρμα πρὸ τῆς φάλαγγος μέσης , πέμψας Πίγρητα τὸν ἑρμηνέα παρὰ **τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν Ἑλλήνων** ἐκέλευσε προβαλέσθαι τὰ ὅπλα καὶ ἐπιχωρῆσαι ὅλην τὴν φάλαγγα.<br/>

>  And when he had passed them all, stationing his chariot in front of the middle of the phalanx (the military formation), and having sent Pigres, the interpreter, to the generals of the Greeks, he ordered them to resent arms and the whole phalanx to move forward. <br/>
>> 1.2.17


>  καὶ Κῦρος μεταπεμψάμενος **τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν Ἑλλήνων** ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἡ ὁδὸς ἔσοιτο πρὸς βασιλέα μέγαν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ·<br/>

>  And Cyrus, having summoned **the generals of the Greeks** began to explain that the road would be to Babylon against the Great King.<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 1.4.11


NB: μεταπεμψάμενος is a compound of a preverb μετά and the verb πέμπει/πέμπουσι and means "to send over to himself," "to summon."




The following example includes a predicate nominative and a genitive.

>  ὥστε **ἄδειπνοι ἦσαν οἱ πλεῖστοι** τῶν Ἑλλήνων<br/>

>  The greater number of the Greek were without having eaten (i.e., had not yet eaten)<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 1.10.19


- ἄδειπνοι: ἄδειπνος, masculine nominative plural, *without having eaten*
- πλεῖστοι: πολύς, superlative, masculine nominative plural,*much, many*
- τῶν Ἑλλήνων, *of the Greeks*



>  ἐκ ταύτης τῆς χώρας ὁ ἄρχων **τοῖς Ἕλλησιν** **ἡγεμόνα** **πέμπει**.<br/>

>  From this territory the ruler of the land sends the Greeks a guide<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 6.1.15




>  οὗτοι δὲ **ξένια** **πέμπουσι**  **τοῖς Ἕλλησιν** ἀλφίτων μεδίμνους τρισχιλίους , οἴνου δὲ κεράμια χίλια καὶ πεντακόσια.<br/>

>  **They send** **hospitality gifts** **to the Greeks**: three thousand medimni of flour, and fifteen hundred ceramia of wine. [Watson 1857]<br/>
>> Xen. Anab. 6.1.15







-  Ἕλλησιν:  Ἕλλην, masculine dative plural, *Hellen; Greek*.
- ξένια: ξένιος, neuter accusative plural, *belonging to a friend and guest, hospitable*.
