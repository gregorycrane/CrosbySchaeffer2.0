## [§ 1](#para1). Declensions.
There are three declensions in Greek,
instead of five as in Latin. To these, because of their general uniformity, the o-stems serve as a good introduction.

## [§ 2](#para2). Ο-Stem Masculines.
Nouns of the ο-declension
whose nominatives end in -ος are usually masculine.

**ποταμός, ποταμοῦ, ὁ — a river**


| | Singular |  | Plural |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
| Nominative | ὁ ποταμός | the river (subject) | οἱ ποταμοί | the rivers (subject) | 
| Genitive | τοῦ ποταμοῦ | of the river | τῶν ποταμῶν | of the rivers | 
| Dative | τῷ ποταμῷ | to/for the river | τοῖς ποταμοῖς | to/for the rivers | 
| Accusative | τὸν ποταμόν | the river (object) | τοὺς ποταμούς | the rivers (object) | 







In like manner inflect ὁ ἀδελφός.

## [§ 3](#para3). Accents.
(a) In nouns of the ο-declension an acute (´) on the ultima in the nominative is changed to a
circumflex (῀) in the genitive and dative of both numbers.

(b) An acute on the ultima changes to a grave (`) when a word follows without intervening punctuation:

<foreign xml:id="p3.1">ἀδελφὸν ἔχει</foreign>: <gloss target="p3.1">s/he has a brother.</gloss>



## [§ 4](#para4). Cases.
The different endings give you information about how a noun is used in a sentence. English retains traces of such a system in its pronouns. Thus we can say:

>  She saw him.<br/>

But a statement such as the following is simply not grammatical:

>  *Him saw she.<br/>

We can, however, within limits violate standard word order for emphasis. Thus, the following sentence is grammatical and emphatic:

>  Him she saw!<br/>

Because Greek words have different endings that help you understand the role of a word, Greek word order is more flexible that than of English (or of other languages with little or not inflection, such as French, Mandarin, and Spanish). Thus the Star Wars character Yoda would sound quite idiomatic if translated directly into Ancient Greek -- thus losing some of his charm.

(a) A noun appears in the nominative when that noun is the subject of a verb or when the noun is the predicate of a verb.

<foreign>οἱ στρατηγοὶ ἦσαν ἀδελφοί</foreign> <gloss>the generals were brothers.</gloss>

"The generals" are the subject of the verb "were" and thus they are in the nominative. We learn that the generals are also brothers. There is no action involved. We simply learn that A is equivalent to B. We say, in this case, that "brothers" is the **predicate** of "the generals."

(b) The genitive suggests relations like those expressed

with of in English. It frequently denotes possession :
<foreign>ὁ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ ἀδελφός:</foreign> <gloss>the brother of the general.</gloss>

(c) The dative suggests relations like those with of or
for in English. It frequently denotes the indirect object :
<foreign>τῷ στρατηγῷ πέμπει τὸν ἀδελφόν:</foreign> <gloss>s/he sends his brother to the general.</gloss>

(d) The accusative is the direct object of a transitive
verb: ἀδελφὸν πέμπει he sends a brother.

## [§ 5](#para5). The Article.

(a) 

**ὁ** Like English, and unlike Latin,
Greek has a definite article. This agrees with its noun
in gender, number, and case. It often serves as a possessive pronoun, as my, your, his, etc. ὁ and οἱ are proclitic
(page xxvii).

(b) Greek has no indefinite article. Many Greek nouns having no definite article require the addition of "a" or "an" when translated into English:

This lovely pass, the Vale of Tempe, between Mt. Ossa and Mt. Olympus,
might have proven more troublesome to the Persians than Thermopylae, had
they not found an easier entrance into Greece. The Peneus River, which
winds through it, is one of the few in Greece that never go dry.</figure>
