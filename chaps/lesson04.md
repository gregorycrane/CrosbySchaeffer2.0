Ο-Stem Neuters. These nouns have a nominative
ending in -ον. They differ from masculines only in the
nominative singular and the nominative and accusative
plural.



As in Latin, nominative and accusative of neuters are
identical in form. In the plural they end in a (Latin a).

τὸ ἄξιον δῶρον
the valuable gift
| Greek | English | Greek | English | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| the valuable gift [nom] | τὸ ἄξιον δῶρον | the valuable gifts [nom] | τὰ ἄξια δῶρα | 
| of the valuable gift | τοῦ ἀξίου δώρου | of the valuable gifts | τῶν ἀξίων δώρων | 
| by means of the valuable gift | τῷ ἀξίῳ δώρῳ | by means of the valuable gifts | τοῖς ἀξίοις δώροις | 
| the valuable gift [acc] | τὸ ἄξιον δῶρον | the valuable gift [acc] | τὰ ἄξια δῶρα | 


In like manner inflect τὸ καλὸν πεδίον.


For accent of δῶρον and πεδίον see § V, d and f [GRC: make these active links].

## [§ 22](#para22). Agreement of Verb.


A neuter plural subject regularly has its verb in the singular:
| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  τὰ δῶρα ἦν ἄξια  |  the gifts were worthy.  |


## [§ 23](#para23). Dative of Place Where. 


The dative with most
prepositions denotes **place where**:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ  |  in the plain  |

(Latin: "in oppido" *in the town*);

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  παρὰ τῷ στρατηγῶ  |  at the side of the general  |



This is our third use of the dative (§§ 4, 16). The use here given is like
that of the Latin ablative in its in relations.
