# Chapter 4: DECLENSION OF O-STEM NEUTERS


>  πᾶν δένδρον ἀγαθὸν καρποὺς καλοὺς ποιεῖ.<br/>
>  Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit. <br/>

Ο-Stem Neuters. These nouns have a nominative
ending in -ον. They differ from masculines only in the
nominative singular and the nominative and accusative
plural.



As in Latin, nominative and accusative of neuters are
identical in form. In the plural they end in a (Latin a).

## [§ 22](#para22). Agreement of Verb.


A neuter plural subject regularly has its verb in the singular:
| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  τὰ δῶρα ἦν ἄξια  |  the gifts were worthy.  |




## [§ 23a](#para23a). παρά -- a three case preposition. 


In this lesson we encounter παρά, the first (and not that last) Greek preposition that can govern the genitive, dative, and accusative, depending upon its meaning.


The core meaning of παρά is "in the vicinity of" or "nearby but not within."  If the object being referenced extends in length or width (e.g., a river, a wall) or if it is a person, you can often translate the core meaning as "from/to/at the side of."


We have already seen the Genitive of Separation (<ref n="9">9</ref>) with prepositions ἀπό and ἐξ. Here are two examples used with παρά:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  παρὰ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ  |  from the side of the general (or just, from the general)  |
|  παρὰ τοῦ ποταμοῦ  |  from the side of/from the river  |

## [§ 23](#para23). Dative of Place Where. 


The dative with most
prepositions denotes **place where**:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ  |  in the plain  |

(Latin: "in oppido" *in the town*);

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  παρὰ τῷ στρατηγῶ  |  at the side of the general  |



This is our third use of the dative (§§ 4, 16). The use here given is like
that of the Latin ablative in its in relations.









<pb n="11"/>


## [§ 24](#para24). Accusative of Place to Which.


The accusative
with many prepositions denotes **place to which** :1

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  εἰς τὸ πεδίον  |  into the plain  |

(Latin: "in oppidum" *into the town*);

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  παρὰ τὸν στρατηγόν  |  to the side of the general  |

## [§ 25a](#para25a). Delphi.


The Temple and Oracle of Apollo at Delphi was considered to stand at the center of the Greek world and was called the "navel of the world." It was ostensibly a Panhellenic site -- open to all Hellenes. Before leaving to travel with Cyrus, Xenophon, for example, consulted the oracle. Delphi had, however, sided with the Spartans and their allies against Athens in the Peloponnesian War. In the Oresteia of Aeschylus, Apollo is powerless to resolve the challenge that the Furies pose after he has pushed Orestes to kill his mother and offered Orestes his full support. Only Athena and the Athenian people can resolve the problem. Apollo and Delphi are sinister forces (in my view) in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. Euripides situated his play the Ion in Delphi but the action of the play emerges from the fact that Apollo had raped an Athenian woman, a sexual act that is not romanticized or blurred but presented as an ugly trauma with lifelong impact.


Delphi was the scene of the other great Panhellenic games, comparable to, if perhaps not quite as prestigious, as those at Olympia. Delphi's games ran on a four year schedule two years before and after the games at Olympia. Lesser panhellenic Games at the Isthmus and at Nemea filled in the other two years of the four year cycle so that each year provided games and a cosmopolitan venue in which to meet.


Here is a view from the end of the [Stadium at Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_of_Delphi) looking towards the starting lines.

were held the famous Pythian Games in honor of Apollo.
