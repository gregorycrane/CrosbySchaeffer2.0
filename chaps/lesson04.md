Ο-Stem Neuters. These nouns have a nominative
ending in -ον. They differ from masculines only in the
nominative singular and the nominative and accusative
plural.

As in Latin, nominative and accusative of neuters are
identical in form. In the plural they end in a (Latin a).

τὸ ἄξιον δῶρον
the worthy gift


In like manner inflect τὸ καλὸν πεδίον.2

Agreement of Verb. A neuter plural subject regularly has its verb in the singular:
τὰ δῶρα ἦν ἄξια
the gifts were worthy.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="23">


Dative of Place Where. The dative with most
prepositions denotes place where: 4

ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ in the plain
(Latin: in oppido in the town);
παρὰ τῷ στρατηγῶ at the side of the general.



2 For accent of δῶρον and πεδίον see § V, d and f.

3 Endings of neuters of the ο-declension in Latin.

4 This is our third use of the dative (§§ 4, 16). The use here given is like
that of the Latin ablative in its in relations.

παρὰ τὸν στρατηγόν to the side of the general.
