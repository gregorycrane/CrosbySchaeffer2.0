# Chapter 2: DECLENSION OF O-STEMS — Continued


>  πόνος γάρ, ὡς λέγουσιν, εὐκλείας πατήρ.<br/>
>  Toil, so they say, is the father of fame.<br/>
>> Euripides, fragment


## [§ 8](#para8). Persistent Accent.


The accent of the nominative
must be learned by observation. It will remain on the
same syllable in the other cases if possible.


An acute on
the penult of a noun of the o-declension remains on that
syllable throughout. 


An acute on the antepenult is drawn
to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).

In like manner inflect ὁ πόλεμος.



Adjectives adopt the gender, number and case of the nouns they modify. As noted above, there are three broad ways of producing Greek nouns. The word Ἕλληνες is, for example, the consontant-stem nominative masculine plural form of Ἕλλην, Ἕλληνος, ὁ, "Greek male" or "Greeks" (when there is a group with men and women. To describe one or more Greek women, the word be  Ἑλληνίς, Ἑλληνίδος, ἡ, "Greek woman.")



If we want to say "three just Greeks", we would produce
<foreign>οἱ δίκαιοι Ἕλληνες</foreign>, i.e., we would not change the way we generate the masculine nominative plural of δίκαιος. We generate the o-stem form for the adjective even though it is modifying a consontantal-stem noun.

## [§ 9](#para9). Genitive of Place from Which.

 The genitive with
many prepositions denotes place from which. This is our second use of the genitive (§ 4).

The walls of Messene still testify to the engineering skill and daring of the
victor of Leuctra. Note particularly the central doorpost of this great gate.
It is nearly nineteen feet long.</figure>

The most brilliant period in Athenian history is justly called the Age
of Pericles. His home was the haunt
