# Chapter 2: DECLENSION OF O-STEMS — Continued


>  πόνος γάρ, ὡς λέγουσιν, εὐκλείας πατήρ.<br/>
>  Toil, so they say, is the father of fame.<br/>
>> Euripides, fragment


## [§ 8](#para8). Persistent Accent.


The accent of the nominative
must be learned by observation. It will remain on the
same syllable in the other cases if possible.


An acute on
the penult of a noun of the o-declension remains on that
syllable throughout. 


An acute on the antepenult is drawn
to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ φίλος  |  the friend  |


| Singular |  | Plural |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| ὁ φίλος | the friend [subj] | οἱ φίλοι | English | 
| τοῦ φίλου | of the friend | τῶν φίλων | English | 
| τῷ φίλῷ | to/for the friend | τοῖς φίλοις | English | 
| τὸν φίλον | the friend [obj] | τοὺς φίλους | English | 



| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ὁ δίκαιος   |  the just person  |

| Singular |  | Plural |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| ὁ δίκαιος | the just person [subj] | οἱ δίκαιοι | the just people [subj] | 
| τοῦ δικαίου | of the just person | τῶν δικαίων | of the just people | 
| τῷ δικαίῳ | to/for the just person | τοῖς δικαίοις | to/for the just people | 
| τὸν δίκαιον | the just person [obj] | τοὺς δικαίους | the just people [obj] | 




In most case, we generate an adverb by using the ending -ως:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  δίκαιος  |  δικαίως  |
|  ἄξιος  |  ἀξίως  |






In like manner inflect ὁ πόλεμος.



Adjectives adopt the gender, number and case of the nouns they modify. As noted above, there are three broad ways of producing Greek nouns. The word Ἕλληνες is, for example, the consontant-stem nominative masculine plural form of Ἕλλην, Ἕλληνος, ὁ, "Greek male" or "Greeks" (when there is a group with men and women. To describe one or more Greek women, the word be  Ἑλληνίς, Ἑλληνίδος, ἡ, "Greek woman.")



If we want to say "three just Greeks", we would produce
<foreign>οἱ δίκαιοι Ἕλληνες</foreign>, i.e., we would not change the way we generate the masculine nominative plural of δίκαιος. We generate the o-stem form for the adjective even though it is modifying a consontantal-stem noun.

## [§ 9](#para9). Genitive of Place from Which.

 The genitive with
many prepositions denotes place from which. This is our second use of the genitive (§ 4).

# Chapter 2: Figure: The ARCADIAN GATE

The walls of Messene still testify to the engineering skill and daring of the victor of Leuctra. Note particularly the central doorpost of this great gate. It is nearly nineteen feet long.




GRC: The [Battle of Leuctra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra) in 371 BCE led the permanent elimination of Spartan power. The battle itself might have been a temporary setback but the Boeotians followed up by invading the Peloponnese and the founding of [Messene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messene) as a defensible city in Messenia. Much of Spartan power had been based upon using terror to keep the inhabitants of Messenia as a subject population. The permanent liberation of Messenia drastically reduced the amount of labor and of resources that Spartans could extract.

# Chapter 2: Figure: Pericles



The most brilliant period in Athenian history is justly called the Age
of Pericles. His home was the haunt
of sculptor and architect, poet and
philosopher. To him we owe above
all the planning and construction of
the matchless Parthenon.
