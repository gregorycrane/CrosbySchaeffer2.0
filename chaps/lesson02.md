[8.] **Persistent Accent**. The accent of the nominative
must be learned by observation. It will remain on the
same syllable in the other cases if possible. An acute on
the penult of a noun of the o-declension remains on that
syllable throughout. An acute ou the antepenult is drawn
to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).

<foreign>ὁ φίλος the</foreign> <gloss>friend</gloss>


<foreign>ὁ δίκαιος the just</foreign> <gloss>man</gloss>



In like manner inflect ὁ πόλεμος.


2 In the previous lesson you found singular and plural labeled. From now on you are given no labels, bnt you can readily tell which is which.
3 As in Latin, adjectives agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case.

[9.] Genitive of Place from Which. The genitive with
many prepositions denotes place from which :

τὸν ἄνθρωπον πέμπει ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ.
he sends the man from the river.
τὸν ἄνθρωπον πέμπει ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ
he sends the man out of the river.
