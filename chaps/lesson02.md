# Chapter 2: DECLENSION OF O-STEMS — Continued


>  πόνος γάρ, ὡς λέγουσιν, εὐκλείας πατήρ.<br/>
>  Toil, so they say, is the father of fame.<br/>
>> Euripides, fragment


## [§ 8](#para8). Persistent Accent.


The accent of the nominative
must be learned by observation. It will remain on the
same syllable in the other cases if possible.


An acute on
the penult of a noun of the o-declension remains on that
syllable throughout. 


An acute on the antepenult is drawn
to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).
