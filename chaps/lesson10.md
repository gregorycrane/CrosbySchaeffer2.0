## [§ 54a](#para54a). Paradigms.


With this chapter, we will have encountered five of the ten most common verb paradigms. The list may look -- and is indeed -- long, with 59 different combinations of tense, mood, and voice. So far we have only looked at the indicative mood and the active voice but already we can unerstand a large number of verb forms. We have not looked at every variation of the paradigms we have covered -- there are omega verbs with stems ending in a vowel that have contractions in Attic an there are archaic verbs that end in -μι, but these forms are all annotated in the text of the Anabasis that we are reading. By the end of lesson 26, we will have covered participles and middle-passive forms and we have the seen the majority paradigms.

## [§ 54](#para54). The Aorist.


Aorist is the name of a tense of the
Greek verb. The name is not used in the inflection of
Latin or English verbs, but many of its functions are
entirely familiar.

The aorist indicative in Greek expresses a single act (that
is, not continued or repeated) in past time. It gives, as
it were, a snapshot of past action, while the imperfect gives
a motion picture:

ἔπαυον I was stopping; ἔπαυσα I stopped.

## [§ 55](#para55). Formation of the Aorist.


(a) The aorist, in common with other secondary tenses, in the indicative has
augment and secondary endings (§§ 42, 43).

<pb n="31"/>
(b) The distinguishing feature of the first aorist is the
suffix -σα- (-σε in the third singular), which obeys the same
phonetic laws as the -σ- of the future (§ 49).

(c) The first aorist infinitive active is always accented on the penult:[note: See § V, f.]

<foreign>ἀθροῖσαι</foreign>,
<foreign>ἁρπάσαι</foreign>.



(d) Some verbs lack a first aorist. Such verbs often have a second aorist, a distinguishing feature of which is a
weakening of the vowel element of thestem, The second aorist indicative is inflected like the imperfect, and the corresponding infinitive has an ending like that of the present infinitive, but it is accented irregularly on the ultima:

- ἄγω, ἤγαγον, ἀγαγεῖν;
- λείπω, ἔλιπον, λιπεῖν;
- φεύγω, ἔφυγον, φυγεῖν.




(e) The third form in the principal parts of a normal
verb shows by the presence of -σα (-α)[note: The type of verbs that have only -α and not -σα in the first aorist will be presented later.]  or -ον whether the
aorist is first or second.

Inflect λύω and φεύγω in the aorist indicative and infinitive.

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="56">


There is usually no difference of meaning between
first and second aorist, the terms signifying merely differ-
ence in formation:

<foreign></foreign>ἔπαυσα *(first aorist) I stopped ; *
<foreign></foreign>ἔλιπον *(second aorist) I left.*


## [§ 57](#para57). Tenses of the Infinitive.


The infinitive, except in

indirect discourse,[note: § 50d] has no time value. The present infinitive denotes continuance or repetition (a motion picture),
while the aorist infinitive denotes a single occurrence (a snap-shot):

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἐθέλει φεύγειν  |  he wishes to keep on fleeing;   |
|  ἐθέλει φυγεῖν  |  he wishes to flee.  |

## [§ 57a](#para57a). The Arch of Hadrian.


Hadrian, one of the "good” emperors of Rome, showed his love for
Athens by beautifying the city. This arch bears on its western face the
legend, "This is the Athens of Theseus, the former city,” and on the eastern
face, "This is the city of Hadrian, not of Theseus."
