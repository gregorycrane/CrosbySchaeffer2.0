## [§ 54](#para54). The Aorist.


Aorist is the name of a tense of the
Greek verb. The name is not used in the inflection of
Latin or English verbs, but many of its functions are
entirely familiar.

The aorist indicative in Greek expresses a single act (that
is, not continued or repeated) in past time. It gives, as
it were, a snapshot of past action, while the imperfect gives
a motion picture:

ἔπαυον I was stopping; ἔπαυσα I stopped.

## [§ 55](#para55). Formation of the Aorist.


(a) The aorist, in common with other secondary tenses, in the indicative has
augment and secondary endings (§§ 42, 43).

(b) The distinguishing feature of the first aorist is the
suffix -σα- (-σε in the third singular), which obeys the same
phonetic laws as the -σ- of the future (§ 49).

(c) The first aorist infinitive active is always accented on the penult:1 ἀθροῖσαι, ἁρπάσαι.

(d) Some verbs lack a first aorist. Such verbs often have a second aorist, a distinguishing feature of which is a
weakening of the vowel element of thestem, The second aorist indicative is inflected like the imperfect, and the corresponding infinitive has an ending like that of the present infinitive, but it is accented irregularly on the ultima:
ἄγω, ἤγαγον, ἀγαγεῖν;
λείπω, ἔλιπον, λιπεῖν;
φεύγω, ἔφυγον, φυγεῖν.
(e) The third form in the principal parts of a normal
verb shows by the presence of -σα (-α)2 or -ον whether the
aorist is first or second.

Inflect λύω and φεύγω in the aorist indicative and infinitive.

There is usually no difference of meaning between
first and second aorist, the terms signifying merely differ-
ence in formation:

ἔπαυσοα (first aorist) I stopped ; ἔλιπον (second aorist) I left.

## [§ 57](#para57). Tenses of the Infinitive.


The infinitive, except in

indirect discourse, has no time value. The present infinitive denotes continuance or repetition (a motion picture),
while the aorist infinitive denotes a single occurrence (a snap-shot):

ἐθέλει φεύγειν he wishes to keep on fleeing ;
ἐθέλει φυγεῖν he wishes to flee.



1 See § V, f.
2 The type of verbs that have only -α and not -σα in the first aorist will be presented later.

The Arch of Hadrian



Hadrian, one of the "good” emperors of Rome, showed his love for
Athens by beautifying the city. This arch bears on its western face the
legend, "This is the Athens of Theseus, the former city,” and on the eastern
face, "This is the city of Hadrian, not of Theseus."
