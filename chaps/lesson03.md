Verb Structure.
(a) In the inflection of a verb
the stem is of fundamental importance. On it are built
the various forms. παύ- is the stem of παύω.

(b) Tense is denoted by appropriate suffixes or prefixes.
The tense suffix of the present is called the variable vowel,
written ε/ο, ο being used before μ or ν, ε elsewhere.

(c) A personal ending is attached to complete the verb.
In the present indicative active the personal ending is
clearly seen only in the first and second persons plural.

Verb Accent. In § 8 we saw that the accent of
nouns was persistent. That of verbs is recessive, that is,

it goes back toward the beginning of the word as far as
the quantity of the ultima will permit. This means that
the accent stands on the antepenult if the ultima is short;
on the penult if the ultima is long -

ἐθέλω, ἐθέλομεν.

## [§ 18](#para18). Vocabulary Notes


The adjective καλός is well attested on Greek vases. People would have the expressions such as Λεαγρὸς καλός ("Leagros is attractive," or, perhaps more accurately, "Leagros is hot!") added to Greek vases in the late sixth and early 5th century B.C. -- there is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to [Kalos inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalos_inscription).


You can see an example of this practice on a famous vase from the Louvre (c. 485-480 BCE). This vase would have been produced in the years after the Athenians had defeated [Darius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great) and his Persian army at [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon) and just before [Xerxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I), Darius' son, would invade Greece in 480 BCE and temporarily [occupy (and destroy) Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_destruction_of_Athens). The vase illustrates a deeply emotional scene from Greek mythology: the goddess Eos (Dawn) holds the dead body of her mortal son, whom Achilles had just killed.

![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/hermogkalos.jpg?raw=true)
The inscription is ΗΕΡΜΟΓΕΝΕΣ ΚΑΛΟΣ, which is Ἑρμογένης καλός in normalized Greek. Note that this Athenian vase uses the Η to indicate aspiration (as with the English 'h') rather than the long ê (as in êta, η).


![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/dourispanted.jpg?raw=true) Two of the other inscriptions are worth looking at. one includes ΗΕΟΣ and ΔΟΡΙΣ ΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, equivalent to Ἐώς and Δοῦρις ἔγραψεν ("Douris wrote/scratched", i.e. Douris was the painter). Instead of a -ψ- we get -φσ-. Note the vase uses a single -Ο- sound that we write as -ου-.


![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/memnon.jpg?raw=true)A second inscription includes ΜΕΜΝΟΝ (the hero Μέμνων) ΚΑΛΙΑΔΕΣ ΕΠΟΙΕΣΕΝ (Καλλιάδης ἐποιήσεν, "Calliades made [it]," i.e., Calliades was the potter). There is an additional inscription (not shown in detail) that includes a nonsense inscription (i.e., letters for decorative effect).
