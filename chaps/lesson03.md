## [§ 13](#para13). The Present Tense.

The present tense denotes action occurring or continuing or repeated in present time:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  παύω  |  I stop. I am stopping. I keep stopping. I do stop.  |

Present Indicative Active or παύω *I stop*





| Greek | English | Greek | English | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| παύω | I stop | παύομεν | we stop | 
| παύεις | you (sg) stop | παύετε | you (pl) stop | 
| παύει | s/he or it stops | παύουσι | they stop | 




Frequency of this paradigm in the Anabasis.

| Freq | Ending | Freq | Ending | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| 85 | -ω | 26 | -ομεν | 
| 26 | -εις | 34 | -ετε | 
| 256 | -ει | 132 | -ουσι | 




Present Infintive Active: παύ-ειν



In like manner inflect ἐθέλω.

## [§ 14](#para14). Verb Structure.


(a) In the inflection of a verb
the stem is of fundamental importance. On it are built
the various forms. παύ- is the stem of παύω.

(b) Tense is denoted by appropriate suffixes or prefixes.
The tense suffix of the present is called the variable vowel,
written ε/ο, ο being used before μ or ν, ε elsewhere.

(c) A personal ending is attached to complete the verb.
In the present indicative active the personal ending is
clearly seen only in the first and second persons plural.

## [§ 15](#para15). Verb Accent.


In § 8 we saw that the accent of
nouns was persistent. That of verbs is recessive, that is,


<pb n="8"/>

it goes back toward the beginning of the word as far as
the quantity of the ultima will permit. This means that
the accent stands on the antepenult if the ultima is short;
on the penult if the ultima is long -

ἐθέλω, ἐθέλομεν.

## [§ 16](#para16). Dative with Adjectives.


The dative is used with many adjectives expressing friendliness, hostility, association, fitness, and the like: 1

πολέμιος ἦν τῷ στρατηγῷ
he was hostile to the general.

## [§ 18](#para18). Vocabulary Notes


The defintions offered for καλός and ἀγαθός demonstrate that both are very positive terms. Each is sometimes translated as "good," "noble" and "honorable." In general, however, καλός describes people and things that are attractive and appealing to us, while ἀγαθός tends to address positive qualities that are not superficial. Thus we get the contrast between men who may be physically attractive but may or may not be courageous. This emerges in a passage from the Anabasis ([7.4.7-7.4.8](https://scaife-dev.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc2:7.4.7-7.4.8?right=perseus-eng2) which describes a company of physically attractive (καλός) soldiers but emphasizes that one of them (at least) was also a "good man" (ἀγαθός). The conclusion of this passage captures this distinction:

>  λόχον ποτὲ συνελέξατο σκοπῶν οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ εἴ τινες εἶεν καλοί, καὶ μετὰ τούτων ἦν ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός.<br/>
>  he had once assembled a company considering nothing else except whether a man was handsome (καλός), and with these men he was a brave man (ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός.).<br/>
>> [Xen. Anab. 7.4.8](https://scaife-dev.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc2:7.4.7-7.4.8?right=perseus-eng2)




The adjective καλός as a compliment plays a significant role in Athenian vases of the early fifth century. People would add the formula "so-and-son is καλός. The phrase Λεαγρὸς καλός ("Leagros is attractive," or, perhaps more accurately, "Leagros is hot!") was particularly common and may reflect the popularity of one particular figure. An separate Wikipedia page dedicated to [Kalos inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalos_inscription) has appeared (reflecting the interest that this topic has attracted in the 21st century as well).


You can see an example of this practice on a famous vase from the Louvre (c. 485-480 BCE). This vase would have been produced in the years after the Athenians had defeated [Darius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great) and his Persian army at [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon) and just before [Xerxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I), Darius' son, would invade Greece in 480 BCE and temporarily [occupy (and destroy) Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_destruction_of_Athens). The vase illustrates a deeply emotional scene from Greek mythology: the goddess Eos (Dawn) holds the dead body of her mortal son, whom Achilles had just killed.

![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/hermogkalos.jpg?raw=true)
The inscription is ΗΕΡΜΟΓΕΝΕΣ ΚΑΛΟΣ, which is Ἑρμογένης καλός in normalized Greek. Note that this Athenian vase uses the Η to indicate aspiration (as with the English 'h') rather than the long ê (as in êta, η).


![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/dourispanted.jpg?raw=true) Two of the other inscriptions are worth looking at. one includes ΗΕΟΣ and ΔΟΡΙΣ ΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, equivalent to Ἐώς and Δοῦρις ἔγραψεν ("Douris wrote/scratched", i.e. Douris was the painter). Instead of a -ψ- we get -φσ-. Note the vase uses a single -Ο- sound that we write as -ου-.


![text](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/chaps/images/memnon.jpg?raw=true)A second inscription includes ΜΕΜΝΟΝ (the hero Μέμνων) ΚΑΛΙΑΔΕΣ ΕΠΟΙΕΣΕΝ (Καλλιάδης ἐποιήσεν, "Calliades made [it]," i.e., Calliades was the potter). There is an additional inscription (not shown in detail) that includes a nonsense inscription (i.e., letters for decorative effect).

This is the famous refrain of the frog chorus in Aristophanes’ comedy, The Frogs. In unison with this unceasing chant Dionysus rows Charon’s boat across the Styx. It is the basis of Yale’s well-known yell. <note>GRC: The "it is" is the America of the 1920s. This Greek phrase was the basis of the Yale "Long Cheer," first publicly used in 1884 and continued through the 1960s: basic information in the [Wikipedia Entry on the Frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs) with links to Yale Alumni Magazines with details.</note>
