Verb Structure.
(a) In the inflection of a verb
the stem is of fundamental importance. On it are built
the various forms. παύ- is the stem of παύω.

(b) Tense is denoted by appropriate suffixes or prefixes.
The tense suffix of the present is called the variable vowel,
written ε/ο, ο being used before μ or ν, ε elsewhere.

(c) A personal ending is attached to complete the verb.
In the present indicative active the personal ending is
clearly seen only in the first and second persons plural.

on the penult if the ultima is long -

ἐθέλω, ἐθέλομεν.
