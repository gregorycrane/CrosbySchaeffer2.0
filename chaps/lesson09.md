>> Periander



[Periander (died c. 555 BCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periander) (see also the [Smith encyclopedia entry](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=periander-bio-1), which has links to primary sources) lived in the seventh and sixth century BCE and is rememberd in very different ways. Herodotus ([5.92-5.92G](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng2:5.92-5.92G/)) represents him as a man who becomes a brutal tyrant of Corinth. But Periander also often appears as one of the Seven Wise Men of early Greece and the saying quoted above is attributed to him in this capacity (see the *Lives of the Philosophers* by [Diogenes Laertius (3rd century CE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius), [1.7](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0004.tlg001.perseus-grc2:1.7/)).

## [§ 49](#para49). The Future Tense.


This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding -σ- to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form -ψ- (πσ) ;
2. A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form -ξ- (κσ);
3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:




πέμπω becomes πέμψω; 


ἄγω becomes ἄξω; 



ἀθροίζω (which is from ἀθροιδ-ιω) becomes ἀθροίσω.



In most instances, the stem is readily recognized in the
present tense, but verbs with stems in ζ are palatals and most verbs with stems in fare dentals. In case of doubt, consult the general vocabulary at the back of the book.

| pers/num | prsent | future | 
| --- | --- | --- 
| 1st sg | πέμπ-ω | πεμ-**ψ**-ω | 
| 2nd sg | πέμπ-εις | πεμ-**ψ**-εις | 
| 3rd sg | πέμπ-ει | πεμ-**ψ**-ει | 
| 1st pl | πέμπ-εις | πεμ-**ψ**-εις |

| 3rd pl | πέμπ-ουσι | πεμ-**ψ**-ουσι | 


In like manner inflect λύω, γράφω, ἄρχω, πείθω.

## [§ 50](#para50). Indirect Discourse.


(a) Verbs whose meaning implies mental action (saying, thinking, or the like) are used to introduce an indirect quotation : the general sends (sent)

<pb n="27"/>

may be stated indirectly:

- I believe the general to be sending
(to have sent), or 
- I believe that the general is sending (sent).

(b) In Latin the main verb in the quoted statement
is always infinitive. The same construction is frequently found in Greek.1

(c) In Latin, the subject of the infinitive in
indirect discourse is always accusative. The
same is true for Greek,
unless the infinitive has
the same subject as the
introductory verb, in
which case the subject
of the infinitive is omitted and any word in
agreement with that unxpressed subject is nominative:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζω τὸν στρατηγὸν διώξειν  |  I think the general will pursue ;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζω διώξειν  |  I think I shall pursue.  |



(d) The tense of the
infinitive in the quoted statement, regardless of the tense of the introductory verb, is the same as that used in the original statement:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  οἱ πολέμιοι διώκουσι  |  the enemy are pursuing ;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζει τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν  |  he thinks the enemy are pursuing;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἐνόμιζε τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν  |  he thought that the enemy were pursuing.  |

1 But in Greek other constructions appear, depending on the introductory verb employed.

# Chapter 9: Figure: ὁδὸς ἀρχαία


This fine roadway, bordered with elevated sidewalks, led from the agora
at Corinth to the harbor. The ancient Greeks did most of their travel by sea
and so had few good roads.
