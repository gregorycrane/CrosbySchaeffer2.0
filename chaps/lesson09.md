>> Periander



[Periander (died c. 555 BCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periander) (see also the [Smith encyclopedia entry](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=periander-bio-1), which has links to primary sources) lived in the seventh and sixth century BCE and is rememberd in very different ways. Herodotus ([5.92-5.92G](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng2:5.92-5.92G/)) represents him as a man who becomes a brutal tyrant of Corinth. But Periander also often appears as one of the Seven Wise Men of early Greece and the saying quoted above is attributed to him in this capacity (see the *Lives of the Philosophers* by [Diogenes Laertius (3rd century CE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius), [1.7](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0004.tlg001.perseus-grc2:1.7/)).

## [§ 49a](#para49a). Principle Parts of a Greek Verb.


There are six different variations on the stem of a Greek verb -- what are called the principal parts. When a verb is regular, we can generate all six of these stems from the present. Verbs such as παύω and λύω are popular in textbooks of Ancient Greek because they are short and regular. The next two chapters introduce the second and third principle parts. Because we are engaging already with authentic Greek sources, we will survey all six principal parts now. In 2024, every major reading environment for Greek texts should be able to give you the morphological analysis of any Greek verb form. The goal here is to cultivate general sense of what all six principal parts do while practicing active command of those principals that we cover in this text book.

The following table compares the principal parts of λύω with those of φέρω, *to bear, to carry*, the most irregular Greek verb. The present of this verb comes from [Proto-Indo-European *bʰéreti](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%86%CE%AD%CF%81%CF%89) and this form survives also in English "to bear" (as it does in Latin <foreign xml:lang="lat">fero</foreign>). Stems from other words, however, were used to fill out the paradigm. If you can't see a linguistic connection between φέρω, οἴσω and ἤνεγκον, you are quite correct. These are three unrelated stems combined to fill out one verb in Greek. It is very very helpful to learn the principal parts of many verbs if you wish to read Greek quickly but you can almost always query a digital reading environment to parse a form that you cannot figure out on your own.

| label | regular | (most) irregular | Freq. | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| present | **λύ**-ω | φέρω | 6227 | 
| future | **λύ**-σω | οἴσω | 308 | 
| aorist | ἔ-**λυ**-σα | ἤνεγκον | 3361 | 
| perfect active | λέ-**λυ**-κα | ἐνήνοχα | 267 | 
| perfect middle/passive | λέ-**λυ**-μαι | ἐνήνεγμαι | 249 | 
| aorist passive | ἐ-**λύ**-θην | ἐνέχθην | 609 | 



While the accent changes depending on the length of the ending, the stem of λύω (-λύ-) does not change. The third and sixth principal parts add an augment (just as the imperfect did) but they use different endings. The third principal and sixth principal parts designate the simple past (which will be covered in the next lesson).


The fourth and fifth principal parts cover the perfect tense. In essense, the perfect describes an event that happened in the past and remains in effect in the present. Crosby and Schaeffer cover the fourth, fifth and sixth principal parts in lessons 52-54.



## [§ 49](#para49). The Future Tense.


This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding -σ- to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form -ψ- (πσ) ;
2. A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form -ξ- (κσ);
3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:




πέμπω becomes πέμψω; 


ἄγω becomes ἄξω; 



ἀθροίζω (which is from ἀθροιδ-ιω) becomes ἀθροίσω.



In most instances, the stem is readily recognized in the
present tense, but verbs with stems in ζ are palatals and most verbs with stems in fare dentals. In case of doubt, consult the general vocabulary at the back of the book.





| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  πέμπω  |  I will send  |
|  πέμψω (πέμπ-**σ**-ω)  |  I will send  |


| pers/num | present | future | 
| --- | --- | --- 
| 1st sg | πέμπ-ω | πεμ-**ψ**-ω | 
| 2nd sg | πέμπ-εις | πεμ-**ψ**-εις | 
| 3rd sg | πέμπ-ει | πεμ-**ψ**-ει | 
| 1st pl | πέμπ-ομεν | πεμ-**ψ**-ομεν | 
| 2nd pl | πέμπ-ετε | πεμ-**ψ**-ετε | 
| 3rd pl | πέμπ-ουσι | πεμ-**ψ**-ουσι | 


In like manner inflect λύω, γράφω, ἄρχω, πείθω.

## [§ 50](#para50). Indirect Discourse.


(a) Verbs whose meaning implies mental action (saying, thinking, or the like) are used to introduce an indirect quotation : the general sends (sent)

<pb n="27"/>

may be stated indirectly:

- I believe the general to be sending
(to have sent), or
- I believe that the general is sending (sent).

(b) In Latin the main verb in the quoted statement
is always infinitive. The same construction is frequently found in Greek.1

(c) In Latin, the subject of the infinitive in
indirect discourse is always accusative. The
same is true for Greek,
unless the infinitive has
the same subject as the
introductory verb, in
which case the subject
of the infinitive is omitted and any word in
agreement with that unxpressed subject is nominative:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζω τὸν στρατηγὸν διώξειν  |  I think the general will pursue ;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζω διώξειν  |  I think I shall pursue.  |



(d) The tense of the
infinitive in the quoted statement, regardless of the tense of the introductory verb, is the same as that used in the original statement:

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  οἱ πολέμιοι διώκουσι  |  the enemy are pursuing ;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  νομίζει τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν  |  he thinks the enemy are pursuing;  |

| Greek | English | 
| --- | -- | 
|  ἐνόμιζε τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν  |  he thought that the enemy were pursuing.  |

1 But in Greek other constructions appear, depending on the introductory verb employed.

* The future of νομίζω (1) does not have a sigma and (2) instead lengthens the ending (usually reflected by a circumflex). The textbook addresses this later and the excercises do not expect you to know the future of νομίζω.

Many verbs with ε in the stem
have cognate nouns or adjectives with ο instead of ε:
λείπω leave, λοιπός left;
λέγω speak, λόγος word or speech ;
πέμπω send (escort), <rs type="lemma">πομπή</rs> procession ;
<rs type="lemma">σπένδω</rs> pour a libation, σπονδή Libation.

Compare Latin tego I cover, toga cloak; English I sing, song.





# Chapter 9: Figure: ὁδὸς ἀρχαία


This fine roadway, bordered with elevated sidewalks, led from the agora
at Corinth to the harbor. The ancient Greeks did most of their travel by sea
and so had few good roads.
