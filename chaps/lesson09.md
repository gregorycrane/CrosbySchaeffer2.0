The Future Tense. This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding -σ- to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form -ψ- (πσ) ;

2. A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form -ξ- (κσ);

3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:

πέμπω, πέμψω;
ἄγω, ἄξω;
ἀθροίζω (ἀθροιδ-), ἀθροίσω.

In most instances, the stem is readily recognized in the
present tense, but verbs with stems in ζ are palatals and most verbs with stems in fare dentals. In case of doubt, consult the general vocabulary at the back of the book.

In like manner inflect λύω, γράφω, ἄρχω, πείθω.

Indirect Discourse.
(a) Verbs whose meaning implies mental action (saying, thinking, or the like) are used to introduce an indirect quotation : the general sends (sent)

<pb n="27"/>

may be stated indirectly
I believe the general to be sending
(to have sent), or
I believe that the general is sending (sent).

(b) In Latin the main verb in the quoted statement
is always infinitive. The same construction is frequently found in Greek.1

(c) In Latin, the subject of the infinitive in
indirect discourse is always accusative. The
same is true for Greek,
unless the infinitive has
the same subject as the
introductory verb, in
which case the subject
of the infinitive is omitted and any word in
agreement with that unxpressed subject is nominative:

νομίζω τὸν στρατηγὸν διώξειν
I think the general will pursue ;

νομίζω διώξειν
I think I shall pursue.

(d) The tense of the
infinitive in the quoted statement, regardless of the tense of the introductory verb, is the same as that used in the original statement:

οἱ πολέμιοι διώκουσι
the enemy are pursuing ;

νομίζει τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν
he thinks the enemy are pursuing;

ἐνόμιζε τοὺς πολεμίους διώκειν
he thought that the enemy were pursuing.

1 But in Greek other constructions appear, depending on the introductory verb employed.
