7	205	1.3.21	τοῖς δὲ ὑποψία μὲν ἦν ὅτι ἄγει πρὸς βασιλέα , ὅμως δὲ ἐδόκει ἕπεσθαι .		They, while suspecting that Cyrus was leading them against the King, nevertheless thought it best to follow him.	['ἄγω']	1	['ἄγει']	['OBJ']
12	349	1.6.3	ὁ δ’ Ὀρόντας νομίσας ἑτοίμους εἶναι αὑτῷ τοὺς ἱππέας γράφει ἐπιστολὴν παρὰ βασιλέα ὅτι ἥξοι ἔχων ἱππέας ὡς ἂν δύνηται πλείστους ·		Then Orontas, thinking that his horsemen were assured him, wrote a letter to the King saying that he would come to him with as many horsemen as he could get.	['γράφω']	1	['γράφει']	['PRED']
15	394	1.7.3	ὦ ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες , οὐκ ἀνθρώπων ἀπορῶν βαρβάρων συμμάχους ὑμᾶς ἄγω , ἀλλὰ νομίζων ἀμείνονας καὶ κρείττους πολλῶν βαρβάρων ὑμᾶς εἶναι , διὰ τοῦτο προσέλαβον .		Men of Greece, it is not because I have not barbarians enough that I have brought you hither to fight for me; but because I believe that you are braver and stronger than many barbarians, for this reason I took you also.	['ἄγω']	1	['ἄγω']	['PRED']
20	169	1.3.10	ὥστε καὶ μεταπεμπομένου αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐθέλω ἐλθεῖν , τὸ μὲν μέγιστον αἰσχυνόμενος ὅτι σύνοιδα ἐμαυτῷ πάντα ἐψευσμένος αὐτόν , ἔπειτα καὶ δεδιὼς μὴ λαβών με δίκην ἐπιθῇ ὧν νομίζει ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ ἠδικῆσθαι .		Therefore, although he keeps sending for me, I decline to go, chiefly, it is true, from a feeling of shame, because I am conscious that I have proved utterly false to him, but, besides that, from fear that he may seize me and inflict punishment upon me for the wrongs he thinks he has suffered at my hands.	['ἐθέλω']	1	['ἐθέλω']	['PRED']
23	155	1.3.5	καὶ οὔποτε ἐρεῖ οὐδεὶς ὡς ἐγὼ Ἕλληνας ἀγαγὼν εἰς τοὺς βαρβάρους , προδοὺς τοὺς Ἕλληνας τὴν τῶν βαρβάρων φιλίαν εἱλόμην , ἀλλ’ ἐπεὶ ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ οὐ θέλετε πείθεσθαι , ἐγὼ σὺν ὑμῖν ἕψομαι καὶ ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ πείσομαι .		And never shall any man say that I, after leading Greeks into the land of the barbarians, betrayed the Greeks and chose the friendship of the barbarians. Rather, since you do not care to obey me, I shall follow with you and suffer whatever I must.	['ἐθέλω']	1	['θέλετε']	['ADV']
