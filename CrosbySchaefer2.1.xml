<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="8"><p><title>Persistent Accent</title>. The accent of the nominative
must be learned by observation. It will remain on the
same syllable in the other cases if possible. An acute on
the penult of a noun of the o-declension remains on that
syllable throughout. An acute ou the antepenult is drawn
to the penult when the ultima is long (§ V, e). Final -οι
of the nominative plural is considered short (§ V, a).

<p>Α-Stem Feminines. Α-declension nouns whose
nominatives end in ᾱ or η are feminine. Because the
feminine article shows η in the singular, nouns and adjectives in η are presented first.<note n="GRC">this makes no sense if you have not learned the next chapter -- it only works for teachers</note> Both types are the same
in the plural

ἡ καλὴ σκηνή the beautiful tent


κώμη village


In like manner inflect ἡ φυγή and ἡ μάχη.4

What forms of the α-declension have the same ending as the corresponding form of the ο-declension? What have similar endings?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="30">
<p>Adjectives.
(a) Adjectives of the ο- and α-declensions have three endings, one for each gender. [Likewise, 
Latin has three endings, one for masculine, feminine and neuter, e.g., bonus, bona, bonum, "good".]


2 For the accent of ἡ, καλή, and σκηνή, see § V, g, h, and i.

3 Endings of feminines of the α-declension in Latin.

4 For the accent of all forms of κώμη and μάχη except the genitive plural.
see§ V, f. The genitive plural of α-stems originally ended in -α(σ)ων [Latin
-arum]. Therefore, words of this declension regularly circumflex the ultima
of the genitive plural because of contraction of vowels.



<pb n="16"/>

(b) Such adjectives accent the feminine genitive plural
like the genitive plural of the o-declension.

Inflect in all three genders ἀγαθός and δῆλος. Compare with paradigms, § 510, a.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="31">
<p>Position of Adjectives.
(a) When an adjective or
an adjective phrase accompanies a noun with a definite
article, the adjective usually stands between the article
and the noun, as in English:

ὁ δίκαιος ἄνθρωπος the just man.

Note that (unlike English) even a prepositional phrase
may stand in this position:
οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἄνθρωποι or οἱ ἐν τῇ κώμῃ1 the men in the village.

The adjective may also follow the noun and have the article repeated with it:
ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ δίκαιος the Just man.

In the above instances the adjective or phrase is said to
have the attributive position.

(b) When an adjective precedes the article or follows
the article and the noun without the article being repeated, it is said to stand in the predicate position:

δίκαιος ὁ ἄνθρωπος or ὁ ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος the man (is) just. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="32">
<p>Dative of Possession. In English we say There is no lid to the box. The Latin says <foreign xml:lang="lat">Puero est gladius</foreign>, <gloss>the boy has a sword</gloss>. So in Greek the dative is used to denote
the possessor, while the thing possessed is subject of the
verb to be:

φυλακὴ οὐκ ἦν τῇ κώμῃ 
the village had no garrison,



1 With an expression like this ἄνθρωποι is implied.

changes in meanings of words. Words are living creatures and as such they coristantly acquire new characteristics and new aptitudes as they adjust themselves to new conditions.

Thus σκηνή, tent or booth, was originally used of the tent or
booth into which an actor withdrew to change his costume.
When the theater became more elaborate, σκηνή referred to the
wall that served as support for painted scenery. From this it
was but a step to σκηνή meaning the scene of an action.</p>

<p>The Future Tense. This tense has the same personal endings as the present. It differs from the present only as to stem, which it forms by adding -σ- to the verb stem. In the case of verbs whose stem ends in a mute, the σ is the occasion of certain changes:

1. A labial (π, β, φ) unites with σ to form -ψ- (πσ) ;

2. A palatal (κ, γ, χ) unites with σ to form -ξ- (κσ);

3. A dental (τ, δ, θ) before σ is dropped:

πέμπω, πέμψω; 
ἄγω, ἄξω; 
ἀθροίζω (ἀθροιδ-), ἀθροίσω.

<head>FIRST AND SECOND AORIST INDICATIVE AND INFINITIVE ACTIVE OF Ω-VERBS</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="54">
<p>The Aorist. Aorist is the name of a tense of the
Greek verb. The name is not used in the inflection of
Latin or English verbs, but many of its functions are
entirely familiar.

The aorist indicative in Greek expresses a single act (that
is, not continued or repeated) in past time. It gives, as
it were, a snapshot of past action, while the imperfect gives 
a motion picture: 

ἔπαυον I was stopping; ἔπαυσα I stopped.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="55">
<p>Formation of the Aorist.
(a) The aorist, in common with other secondary tenses, in the indicative has
augment and secondary endings (§§ 42, 43).

<pb n="31"/>
(b) The distinguishing feature of the first aorist is the
suffix -σα- (-σε in the third singular), which obeys the same
phonetic laws as the -σ- of the future (§ 49).

(c) The first aorist infinitive active is always accented on the penult:1 ἀθροῖσαι, ἁρπάσαι.

(d) Some verbs lack a first aorist. Such verbs often have a second aorist, a distinguishing feature of which is a
weakening of the vowel element of thestem, The second aorist indicative is inflected like the imperfect, and the corresponding infinitive has an ending like that of the present infinitive, but it is accented irregularly on the ultima: 
ἄγω, ἤγαγον, ἀγαγεῖν;
λείπω, ἔλιπον, λιπεῖν;
φεύγω, ἔφυγον, φυγεῖν.
(e) The third form in the principal parts of a normal
verb shows by the presence of -σα (-α)2 or -ον whether the
aorist is first or second.

Inflect λύω and φεύγω in the aorist indicative and infinitive.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="56">
<p>There is usually no difference of meaning between
first and second aorist, the terms signifying merely differ-
ence in formation:

ἔπαυσοα (first aorist) I stopped ; ἔλιπον (second aorist) I left.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="para" n="57">
<p>Tenses of the Infinitive. The infinitive, except in

indirect discourse, has no time value. The present infinitive denotes continuance or repetition (a motion picture),
while the aorist infinitive denotes a single occurrence (a snap-shot): 

ἐθέλει φεύγειν he wishes to keep on fleeing ;
ἐθέλει φυγεῖν he wishes to flee.



1 See § V, f.
2 The type of verbs that have only -α and not -σα in the first aorist will be presented later.

<p>PRONUNCIATION OF ANGLICIZED GREEK PROPER NAMES

(a) Every educated person should know how to pronounce correctly the many Greek proper names that have
passed into English literature and English speech. Especially is this to be expected of every person who has been
privileged to study Greek.

(4) Here are a few simple rules which will help:

1. Because most Greek proper names have come into English via Latin, custom demands first that the Greek letters shall


<pb n="39"/>

be replaced by their Latin equivalents.



These can be learned from

§§ I and II, but note especially that 
αι passes into  or e, 
ει into î or ê, 
οι into oe or ê 
(when final, οι becomes î), 
ου into û, 
υ into y (except in diphthongs), 
ος into us:

θησεῖον Theseum, 
Φοῖβος Phoebus,
Φίλιπποι Philippi, 
Ἐπίκουρος Epicurus,

Αἴσχυλος Aischylus, 
Αἰθιοπία Ethiopia, 
Ἀριστείδης Aristides,
Κύκλωψ Cyclops,

Φοῖνιξ Phoenician

2. Use the ordinary English sounds for the letters, remembering that c (for k) and g are “soft” before e or i sounds.

3. Names that have become  very common in English are likely to have lost or changed their inflectional endings:

Ἀθῆναι Athens,  
Συράκουσαι Syracuse, 
Ὅμηρος Homer, 
Πλάτων Plato, 
Ἀλέξανδρος Alexander.

Bronze Boy FROM MARATHON

This head belongs to a beautiful statue found in almost perfect condition by a fisherman in the Bay of Marathon in 1925.

4. The anglicized form is to
be accented according to the
Latin rules: two-syllabled
words accent the penult; poly-syllables accent the penult, if
long, otherwise the antepenult:
A'thens, Ody'sseus, Pene'lope.1

(c) Transliterate into English and pronounce :

Κυθέρεια 
Ἀγαμέμνων 
Βορέᾱς 
Κῦρος
Ἡρόδοτος 
Ἀφροδίτη <note>Final η, when transliterated inta é, is regularly sounded.</note>
θουκυδίδης 
Ἀπόλλων
Ζεύς 
Χάρων 
Σωκράτης 
Λυκοῦργος

(a) Words other than proper names have suffered still greater changes as to ending:

φιλοσοφία philosophy

ἄγγελος angel, 
ὠκεανός ocean,


σπασμός spasm,



φιλόσοφος philosopher.

<p>THE PHALANX

By means of the phalanx, invented and developed by
Greeks, Alexander the Great imposed his will upon most
of the civilized world. In the hands of the Romans, who
were quick to grasp its possibilities, it grew into the famous
legion.


“The average depth of the phalanx was eight men,
although it occasionally reached sixteen, even before the
time of the Macedonians. Epaminondas made his left
wing about fifty ranks deep. The spear might be twenty-one feet long, or even twenty-four in Hellenistic times.
Five or six rows of spear points would project beyond the
front rank making an impenetrable barrier. The spears
of the rear ranks rested upon the shoulders of men in front
with their points directed upward. The formation looked
like a huge porcupine with the quills pointing in one
direction. The Roman consul, Lucius Aemilius, a seasoned
veteran, confessed to friends at Rome that he had never
seen anything more terrible and alarming than the Macedonian phalanx of Perseus.”

<p>Uses of Participles.
(a) A participle, when used in
the attributive position ($ 31, a), has the force of an attributive adjective. his is called the attributive participle :

ὁ διαρπάζων στρατιώτης the plundering soldier, 

The attributive participle often has its noun implied
and may be translated by a noun or a relative clause. This
is the regular equivalent of the English he who, those who:

οἱ φεύγοντες the fugitives or those who are fleeing.

(4) A participle, when used without an article and in
agreement with a noun or pronoun expressed or implied,
is called the circumstantial participle. It may denote time,
manner, means, cause, condition, concession, or any attendant
circumstances of an action.

φεύγοντες δια-βαίνομεν τὸν ποταμόν in flight<note>in fleeing: GRC</note> we cross the river ;
ἔχων χρήματα εἶχες ἂν φίλους if you had money, you would have friends.</p></div>
