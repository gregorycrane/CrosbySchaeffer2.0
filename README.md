## Towards an interactive Crosby and Schaeffer 2.0

The goal is to give students examples of every feature that they learn in real source texts, while also show the precise frequency of any given feature in the learning
corpus. Crosby and Schaeffer is clearly geared for the Anabasis of Xenophon and we use the Anabasis as our learning corpus. Book 1 (out of 7 books) of the Anabasis
contains more than 10,000 running words (if we include punctuation) and this is quite large enough for a challenging year of study. (By comparison, Pharr's Homeric Greek 
covers Iliad 1, which has just over 6,000 running words).

### Linguistic analysis of Xenophon's Anabasis

This messy [Jupyter Notebook]([url](https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/analyzeCS2.0.ipynb)https://github.com/gregorycrane/CrosbySchaeffer2.0/blob/main/analyzeCS2.0.ipynb)  analyzes Crosby and Schaeffer vocabulary. It also searches for grammatical features in Anabasis 1.
